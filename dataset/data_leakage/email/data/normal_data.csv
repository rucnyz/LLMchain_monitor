dear eb,
hope you had a fun and healthy thanksgiving.  just got
peru.  it was great fun, except that one time in a
bakery, i left my backpack there.  returned 7 minutes
later and it was gone.  goodbye camera, palm pilot and
most importantly journal.  it was the most expensive
queso empanada, ever!  anyway, going to europe on the
5th.  then off to school... rat guts.

I will close the auction at noon as I advertised, if nobody buys them by
then, I'll sell them to you for $300.  I know what you mean, the combo of
Bonds getting walked all the time and the Stros getting killed really sucks.

John:

Natural is overbought on a short-term basis but my analysis has not produced
any daily strength patterns, which normally indicates the rally has more to
go.  I will not see a daily strength pattern until Monday at the earliest.
Potential for Nov. gas to see 249 - 258 into next week.  Look for market to
continue higher for awhile longer.

John,

Just wanted to make sure everything went o.k.  I neglected to remind you 
again when we talked today about obtaining the Certificate of Occupancy, so I 
hope that the Seller delivered it as she had promised.  If not let me know so 
that we can find an immediate solution.  The only other things I would 
caution you on at this point would be as follows:

1)  Make sure to put together your list of warranty repairs prior to 30 days 
from today's date and to deliver same to the Seller within such time period 
(per the warranty agreement).

2)  Make sure to follow up with the Seller about the fireplace.  She is 
supposed to finish that work within 60 days from today's date.

3)  Make sure to compare your title policy, when it comes in the mail, to the 
marked Title Commitment you received today.  There shouldn't be anything in 
the policy that is not in the Title Commitment.  When you get the policy, you 
can send a copy to me and I will be glad to confirm this for you.

4)  You should get the recorded deed in the mail from the title company or 
the county clerk.  If you do not receive it within 30 days, call the title 
company and ask that they find it or obtain a certified copy for you.

If there is anything you need, just let me know.

We do not have to pay the ISO the $86 million.  They will estimate what we should owe them and bill us for that amount.  They also want to make sure that we have remedied the problem.  Murray O'Neil will be the point person with the ISO.  Who will be the lead within the EES Settlements organization to ensure that we adequately remedy this problem?  That person should work with Murray to craft a response to the CAISO.

Good news.  See e-mail below.  Epstein is our Controller.  Spence is our
Director of Settlements.  Bill Regan is our Chief Financial Officer.
On another note, it has been requested that a detailed explanation be given
and what will be done to prevent this in the future.  I hope you can

Aleck & Richard:

Just a quick update following my meetings yesterday in the Premier's Office.

Without question, the majority of decision-makers were leaning strongly
towards announcing a firm Spring 2002 opening date.

It has been conveyed to me that our (Enron/GPC) efforts prior to the
announcement by the Minister made a significant impact on the softening of
the announcement, making May 2002 a deadline and leaving the possibility for
a November opening.  While other stakeholders were advocating a November
opening (also largely thanks to the Enron/GPC effort, e.g. Board of Trade),
their arguments did not provide the same technical persuasiveness (with
concerns such as those regarding supply) as the Enron effort.  This
expertise coupled with sensitivity towards the political needs and pressures
resulted in an argument that surpassed those being made by some of the
industrials.

Recent comments by the Minister and others also suggest that the
government's message may change to ""working towards November"".  The
Lay/Harris meeting, our ongoing efforts to mitigate the influence of market
opening opponents, and our efforts to persuade decision-makers that the four
conditions have been met should help us meet our objectives.

Best regards,

First, congrats on buying a great house for free.  Need to put up a fence in the back because Bob is a pain and somehow convinced me to take done the fence.  We never did figure out the combo for the back door.

Jeff:
Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained 
to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose 
commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far 
as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential 
information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron is 
the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term ""Event 
of Default"" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With 
respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is 
okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since 
I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For 
example, 7(b)(ii) seems to be a trigger that could accidentally happen and 
the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on 
this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.

Ernest - I was just wondering if I'll start getting e-mails reporting the
NP-15 and SP-15 indices. Are these reports generated? If so, who should I
contact to get them? Thanks for all your help in this matter.

I can only begin to imagine how stressed things must be for you right now. Jerril and I have our fingers crossed that things work out OK for you during the transition. Hopefully, the people at Dynegy will recognize what a smart, honest and harworking guy you are and reward you appropriately.

Yeah, I think I shocked a lot of people, including Kam and others. Well, as shitty as the hours were, I actually liked risk.  I will be working in Risk at my new position at EnergyUSA.  However, a long day for them is 9-10 hours, which is more like a short day at Enron.  I think fewer hours and better pay will make working conditions much better but I am really going to miss a lot of the people that I worked with at Enron.  If was a very fun atmosphere to work in, even during the last few days with all of this merger talk going on.

That news shocked me because I didn't see itc oming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.

Best,
Jeff

Gang,
 
DWR believes it is not a party to any proceeding at the CPUC on its rev req, but, apparently, is trying to move things along by allowing a bit of a process (although it appears to be self-adjudicating).  It is seeking written comments by Oct 26 (lots of notice) on its latest revenue requirement and wants data requests submitted by COB today.  I'm assuming that we don't want to participate.  Let me know if any of you believe otherwise.

Let us look to pre-pay until the 2 January, to avoid any further default, to be confident that we are able to meet the terms of any final Standstill Agreement and to continue to serve our contracts, subject to Dana's view as to the pricing over this period, to ensure that we are still likely to make money on these contracts during this period.

Judge  Birchman's November 23rd Order sets January 8, 2002 as the hearing date for  202(c) issues. As we discussed during the November 20th phone conference, the  witness for the State Water Contractors, Richard Jones, is not available for  cross examination on January 8th. As we agreed during the phone conference, Mr.  Jones will be available during the December hearing dates for cross examination  on the 202(c) issues.  
 
Since he will be traveling in for the hearings we need to set a date within  the December hearings when the cross examination (if any) will take place.   We suggest that he be available on December 21st, the last day of the  December hearings. If anyone prefers that he be available on a different date,  please advise us by the end of the this week (November 30th) so that travel  plans can be made.

Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to buyers or they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.	Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be addressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there are no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.

Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar provision in its tariff.

The American Gas Association will host a Gas Cost Stabilization Seminar
on September 20-21, 2001 at AGA, 400 N. Capitol St. NW, Washington, DC.
Attendees at this day-and-a-half meeting will learn what caused recent
volatility in natural gas prices and how risk-management tools can
mitigate gas cost volatility.  Speakers will discuss the risks and
rewards of various cost-stabilization techniques.  Regulators and
industry experts will debate regulatory philosophies and practices
regarding volatility mitigation strategies.  The seminar will appeal to
regulators, energy service consultants and lawyers, financial and
investment professionals, supply planners, and gas utility rate and
regulatory experts. Seats are limited.  Please see the attached agenda
and registration materials for fees, hotel arrangements and additional
information.  We look forward to seeing you at this important event.

Since I am Chairman of the NERC Interchange Subcommittee (Policy 3 Interchange), Grid South has approached my group to review a proposal that it become the interchange scehduling agent for all its members.

This is a preliminary proposal at this time and Grid South is ""shopping"" how its proposal meets Policy 3 requirements. 

I would like you all to point out ""holes"" in their proposal that can establish road-blocks for non-control areas from competing.  Assuming that multiple control areas will be part of their structure, please consider: ""What more should GridSouth do and what less should its control area members do?""  

I do not want to compromise my leaderhip position at NERC, so please keep these documents and discussions internal to Enron at this time.

Grid South representatives will be at the Interchange Subcommittee Friday the 29th, so please give me your open and honest opinions by Thursday evening.

On behalf of the Jones Graduate School at Rice University, we would like to
thank all of the company representatives who have submitted Action Learning
Project (ALP) proposals. Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing
all proposals received.

We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our
December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your
project. We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance.

Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and
we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far,
many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase
the diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give
our students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal
project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.

Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the
Jones School ALP program.

It's nice to hear from you. I am sure that you can always come back 
to Enron if you don't like living in New York.

I used to work for Salomon and chances are you will be working in the same 
building in lower Manhattan where I spent 7  years of my life.

I hope you have a great Holiday  Season.

Hi, Vince
Just got off the phone with Andy Lewis, a trader for the Midwest. We had so much similarities in terms of orientation, starting from the backroom and moving to the backroom. We were on the phone more than an hour at 11:28 pm Texas time (I think an hour and 15 minutes). 
I hope that I have addressed his initial reaction that I am overqualified. We shared a few anecdotes, several moments of laughter. There were 18 selected for the phone screen out of the 200+ resumes. 
After a deliberation with Andy's colleagues, there will be another set of calls (the schedule has yet to be determined). That is it for now. I will let you know what transpires in the next few days. Hopefully, I can meet you when I'll be given the chance to visit Enron in Houston.
Have a safe trip.
Sincerely,
Yvan

I would love to see Enron's trading floors.  However, Arthur is out of town
till tomorrow evening. I will be seeing him before the seminar so I can ask
him about Friday. We can discuss this before or after the seminar. Also, you
are most welcome to join the group that will be going with Darrell for lunch
after the seminar.

Praveen,


Sorry for not getting back to you earlier. The last few weeks were extremely
hectic for obvious reasons. Would you like to visit, together with Arthur,
Enron's trading floors? This week may be the last chance, as the results of
the auction of our gas and power trading units will be announced Thursday.
Wednesday or Friday would work for me.



My employment situation has not been resolved yet but it may finally happen
later this week.

I shall see at the Darrell's seminar on Thursday and I can give you more
details.

Regretfully, Vince just informed me that he will not be able

He will be sending in his place, Yinxi Huang (Alex), Manager,

Alex's specialty is the power industry within the Research Group
and he is a very personable young man, proficient in the power 
field.  He will basically give the presentation that Vince has 
prepared, but is currently updating.  I will send a copy as soon 
as possible.  We are also putting together a ""bio"" for Alex and 
will forward it as soon as possible.

Enclosed is information on textual mining and expert systems I spoke to you about in the lobby.  

EDS is currently providing commercial applications using experts systems and textual mining to derive value for our customers.  The presentation below has two examples of current applications.  It seems to me that there a multiple applications for this type of program within Enron which would have short payback periods.

Please let me know if you wish to investigate further.

Additionally, I could expound on my interest and work concerning numerical methods for pricing and hedging derivative securities.  A formal interview could be established at a later date.  For your reference, I've attached a copy of my resume.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @GLOBAL v5.0.3. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email. If you wish to receive a CD, please send
an email to info@fea.com. Please see below for more information regarding
this new release.

Here's an overview of the new and changed features since version 5.0.2.

Bug Fixes

A bug was fixed for window barrier options (@GLOBAL Barrier & Digitals). The
bug affected results when the window period starts at time zero, or has
already started, and different yields are specified over and outside the
window period.

Here's an overview of the new and changed features in version 5.0.2 since
5.0.1.

Bug Fixes

MCEQUITY_ASIAN and MCEQUITY_ASIAN_CLIQUET can now be evaluated on expiration
date. A bug was fixed in MCEQUITY_ASIAN_CLIQUET that affected valuation when
value_date was equal to the last averaging date of any reset period.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this
opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..

Michelle Mendoza

Vince,


these are the contacts from UH.  
I would recommend that for a first contact the following people be involved:
Larry Pinsky (PhysicsChair)
Joe McCauley (professor)
George Reiter (professor)
Their coordinates and some schedules are below.    If Larry is out of town, 
prof. Gunaratne would be a good alternative.

Please let me know how I can help further.

Hi Vince!

Thanks for the information below!

I spoke with Tom Piazze today.  I'll be meeting with him at 3:30 on the 20th 
to discuss the WeBI contract.  I'll also be meeting with Wharton's broadband 
(technical people) before our meeting with the students.  Further, I hope to 
meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.

Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly 
stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.

I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation at 
the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to 
New York.

Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the 
students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30?  
Please let me know!

Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested 
in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.

Thanks Vince!

Have a great wekend!

stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.

I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation at 
the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to 
New York.

Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the 
students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30?  
Please let me know!

Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested 
in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.

Thanks Vince!

Have a great wekend!

Hi Vince!

Thanks for the information below!

I spoke with Tom Piazze today.  I'll be meeting with him at 3:30 on the 20th 
to discuss the WeBI contract.  I'll also be meeting with Wharton's broadband 
(technical people) before our meeting with the students.  Further, I hope to 
meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.

Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly

Hi Greg!

Here is the information regarding the Dec 13th event at Wharton.  Wharton is 
beside itself with excitement at your acceptance, and communicated that with 
Jeff Skilling at his visit there this past Thursday.  

They're also very interested in discussing their WeBI program with you and 
would like to arrange to do that the day of your evening presentation, or 
perhaps the following day, whichever suits your schedule.  This was also 
discussed with Jeff Skilling--he is clearly interested in the program, but 
will be especially looking to your input, along with that of Vince Kaminski, 
Jeff Shankman and me, in determining Enron's decision to participate.  As I 
mentioned previously, Vince, Jeff and I think Enron's involcvement with WeBI 
holds very positive potential. Financially, it involves a contribution of 
$250,000 for 4 years.

Please see the request for your ""Bio"" and desired inclusion of program 
materials, as well as the contact at Wharton, toward the end of the message 
below.

Let me know by eMail or voice mail (3-6117) how University Affairs can 
further these efforts.

Thanks!

Dear Amy:

Thank you and your colleagues for taking the time to video-conference with
us at MIT and AA professionals associated with NEVRL.  I  enjoyed the
exchange and was left impressed by the technical savvy and keen interest in
research on part of Enron.  I look forward to hearing from you sometime
soon.

As I recall, we agreed that Enron would forward a few issues/questions that
NEVRL could potentially address.  Once we have a meeting of minds on the
set of issues, we can discuss further how best to collaborate and
accomplish our goals.  I believe both sides would benefit immensely.  MIT
faculty can research questions relevant to industry and you might receive
some answers you are looking for!

With best regards,

S.P.

I certainly understand.  However, we are going to try to move the date up a
week or two to make sure there are no conflicts for anyone.  We've had some
trouble getting our hotel date even this far in advance.  I'll be back in
touch when we get it ironed out.

I've been invited to speak at the conference below in Amsterdam in April. 
This is along with the Monte Carlo conference a week later which Stinson has 
forwarded my name for. Both are by EPRM, and shouldn't take too much time to 
prepare as will be on similar topics to the previous conference at which I 
spoke. Should I go to both, or start prioritising these events?

I would like to bring two people for an interview 

One of them sent me a message that is attached below.
I am including the info about the 2nd gentleman below.

I would like to include myself, Vasant Shnabhogue, Tanya Tamarchenko
Stinson Gibner, Zimin Lu, Paulo Issler,  Alex Tang on the interview list.

It would be great if we could bring them this week on Friday. Tanya
will be at a training course next week. This means that if Friday this week

we should shoot for interviews in 2 weeks.

Dear Vince,

I spoke with you briefly yesterday regarding Grant Masson.  You informed me
that he is no longer an Enron employee.  I have also been informed that
Grant has not yet been replaced.

I am inquiring because Infocast would like to have an Enron representative
speak at an upcoming conference entitled ""Power Crisis in the West: Status &
Outlook for Wholesale and Retail Markets"".  Is there someone else at Enron
whom you would recommend to speak at the conference?

I have attached the program agenda for your review.  Knowing a bit about
Grant's expertise, I specifically wanted him to participate on the panel
""How Will Power Prices Play Out in 2001-2005?"".  Please let me know if there
is someone else at Enron whom I should speak with regarding this topic, or
others that may be of interest to Enron.

I look forward to working with Enron on this conference; it is certainly
going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy surrounding
the situation in San Diego.

Kind Regards,
Nia Mansell

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

TIME: Monday, February 12, 2001, 2:00-5:00pm 
LOCATION: Westin Galleria, Houston, TX 
COST: The workshop is a deliverable to Members of The Hole in the Barrel: 
Capturing Value from a Volatile Oil Price. 

For non-Members of the Hole in the Barrel Multiclient Study, a fee of 
US$3,500 will be charged (fee can be applied to the purchase of the study).

Please visit our online prospectus for the study located at: 
http://www20.cera.com/offerings/details/0,1504,CID1075,00.html?

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further

Rabi De <",rabide@yahoo.com
"Please conduct text continuation for the below context: 
Did you guys get this?

I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about
risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to
you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use
classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision
is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the
President's curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the
customers' curves or equivalently the PUC's curve.

I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the
assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for
large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility
curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.

Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its
role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market
participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher
than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower
than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers
(including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the
certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower
bid prices.

Just some random thoughts,
Michael

Dear Steven,

Further to our conversation I am delighted that you will be speaking at the
forthcoming Real Options conference which will take place on Monday 27th &
Tuesday 28th November in Central London.

I have attached the pdf of the conference Vince spoke at in February and the
draft programme of the November conference.

As discussed could you please email me with a suggested talk title and
between 5 and 8 bullet points to be included in the conference programme.
It would be great if you could emphasise the practicality of your talk and
that you will be using your own experience of working with real options at
Enron as part of the talk.

If you do have the delegate list from the IQPC conference it would be useful
to see who attended so that we can improve on our marketing for the
conference in november.  You can either email me or fax it to me on 020 7393

Hi  Vince, Krishna & I talked to this student while were at Sycamore 
Networks.  He appears to be very qualified for our EBS Analytics group. 
Sycamore has a professional services team that provides consulting on network 
optimization modeling, etc. They do this to push their products, etc....  One 
of the professional in that group highly recommended this student. We are 
currently working with the same professional at Sycamore to perform our 
intial network design analysis (since the deadline was today!).   I have 
arranged for the MIT student's visit to Houston along with the two Standford

Good afternoon Mike:

I certainly am interested in determining if there may be a potential fit
there at Enron.  I am very enthusiastic to apply my finance and meteorology
backgrounds in a market-based environment that is driven to achieve
unprecedented efficiencies.  Attached are two documents:  1) a
business-focused resume, and 2) an abbreviated Meteorology CV.

Graduate Meteorology coursework included Advanced Atmospheric Dynamics I and
II, Advanced Physical Meteorology, Boundary Layer Modeling, Numerical
Modeling, Research Methods in Meteorology, and Turbulence.

I will look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Greg Hunt

Dear Colleagues:

We are writing to remind you of an opportunity for in-depth education on
electric power restructuring in Texas through a training workshop offered
by the University of Houston.

With the passage of Senate Bill 7, Texas is moving forward with electric
power restructuring.  What will the new marketplace look like?  How will it
function?  How will existing business opportunities be affected, and what
new ones are likely to emerge?  Join us for a comprehensive two-day
training workshop March 1-2, 2000 that addresses these issues and
accommodates both new and experienced professionals.  Hosted by the Energy
Institute at the University of Houston's College of Business
Administration, the training workshop features an introductory day that
will refresh participants on the basics of the electric power market and
key aspects of the restructuring process in Texas and the U.S.  The second
day targets advanced issues in the emerging marketplace and case studies
for practicioners.  The training workshop will be held at the Center for
Executive Development at the UH-CBA.  Instructors are Ms. Dottie Anderson
and Mr. Jim Stanton, each with extensive experience in the power industry
and ERCOT implementation, and Dr. Michelle Michot Foss, director of the
Energy Institute (see biographies, following workshop details).  To
register, return the form below with your information.  Payment, or an
indication of payment, must be received by Monday, February 28.  For more
information, contact ",energyinstitute@uh.edu

Vince,
 
We met several months ago with Peter Nance of Teknecon Energy  Risk Advisors (TERA) to discuss Enron's possible participation in our  benchmarking study.
 
Our original schedule has slipped, and I was wondering if you  might reconsider participating.  Here is a presentation that Peter did for  us in Washington DC where 50 companies came to learn more about the study.   Also attached is a sample list of metrics.
 
The kick-off meeting will be in the second week of October in  Houston.  Please let me know if Enron would be interested in joining the  study team.  We have several companies in the top 20 signed up.  I  would be happy to review the list with you over the phone.

I am forwarding you the resume of Marilyn Mielke. She is a very highly
educated and accomplished person. She has a background in science but 
no skills required in my group. I was impressed with her excellent
communication and social skills - maybe she can acquire
necessary skills going through the Analyst/Associate program.

She was knocking on the Enron's door for a long time.

Sorry for a delay in responding to  your previous message.

My boss, Greg Whalley will be traveling a lot during the next 2 weeks, 
visiting different offices of Enron. It seems at this point that we may be able to
visit  you in Santa Fe in the first part of the week of September the 3rd.
Please, advise me of your availability.

I apologize for our inability to commit to a firm date at this point. I would like to assure 
you of our continuing interest in working with you in the future.

Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

I discussed this with Vince Kaminski and he said that, while we would be
glad to assist you, the time involved in ordering and collecting the money
(they are pretty expensive), distributing the books, etc. would be too time 
consuming for us at this time.  

You can go to www.lacimagroup.com and order the books directly.  Tell
them you are ordering the books for use at Enron and they should give you 
a 15% discount.

I am sorry that we cannot do this at this time.

 Little Amy was in the garden filling in a hole when her neighbor peered over the fence. Interested in what the cheek-faced youngster was doing, he politely asked, ""What are you up to there, Amy?"" 

 ""My goldfish died,"" replied Amy tearfully, without looking up, ""and I've just buried him."" 

 The neighbor was concerned, ""That's an awfully big hole for a goldfish, isn't it?"" 

 Amy patted down the last heap of earth then replied, ""That's because he's inside your damn cat.""

Mark,

Thanks for the quick response.  Yes, working in Europe has been a good
experience and certainly intellectually stimulating on many levels.
However, I'm probably not going to consult in 2002.  Not exactly my ""cup of
tea.""  It can be less than fulfilling coming in and out of projects and
never having the opportunity to actually start and finish an opportunity.
With that said, I am grateful for the experience and have definitely varied
my skill set as hopefully reflected in my resume.

I would imagine life at Enron has been challenging with the constant change
and bad press as of late.  I'm hopeful the worst is behind Enron and
smoother waters lie ahead.

Anyway, anything you can do for me in terms of getting my resume into the
right hands would be much appreciated.

As discussed, attached please find the list of museums and coporate/public
collections in which Jeff Koons is represented.
Given the conservative nature of many of the corporate/public collections as
well as the prestigious nature of the museums, I think there should be no
issue with regard to the controversy of Koons' work.  I look forward to
hearing from you as soon as you talk to Skilling and am available to chat
before that even if you would like.  You should also feel comfortable
calling Ned on this topic.  His number at work is:  713-525-9401.

Cheryl,

Thanks for the update.  I like the progress.

I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least 
it will help.  What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives 
us a very high bid price to build the house  because we are captive.  What do 
you suggest as a possible remedy?  Some sort of checks on allowing others to 
bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?  Without a 
cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.  What do you think?

A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.

2. Earnest money:  I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.  
3. Title policy:  Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it 
is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional 
15% cost?  I don't have any idea.
4.  have provided
5.  not sure i understand this
6.  yes, delete 
7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector
8. add in clarifying statement
9. agree to add builder obligation.  I am fine with a quick closing date and 
needs specificity.  Does he have an estimated time of completion?
10. Rollback taxes:  I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be 
protected here.
11. add this to contract.  Flare may want the money but we should try it.

I hope this helps.  After you review and discuss these issues, let's get 
together via phone and discuss outstanding issues.  Please call Cathy 
Phillips with a time to talk.  She can be reached at 713 853-6898

Hello Jeffrey,
I came across your company information as I was conducting research on the Dallas Business Journal website. The article mentioned that Enron was moving into an office complex in Frisco, TX and could potentially employ up to 100 employees. 
I have recently been laid off as a contract/corporate recruiter with Nortel Networks and am interested in pursuing opportunities with Enron as you grow into your new Frisco location. By bringing my recruiting skills and background in-house as a contract or corporate recruiter, Enron can save thousands of dollars in potential external headhunter fees.

Mr. Skilling, by studying Enron I've concluded that you, its driving force, are an adventurer at heart, one who loves new ideas, discovering and exploring new worlds of thought, and taking the untried path rather than the proven, overly-traveled one.  That is why I am reaching out to you personally.
As you know, the world is now one huge marketplace uniting many different cultures, attitudes and beliefs.  Never before in the history of the world has there been a greater need for people to embrace diversities with an understanding that our differences can work together to produce profound advantages for all if only we will learn the art of tolerance, acceptance and understanding.  And what company is better qualified to carry this message than the culturally-diverse and wildly-successful workforce of Enron?
I would like to work with Enron in a public relations capacity, traveling throughout the nation and abroad, educating the public about the dangers of intolerant attitudes and sharing the success story of Enron as a lesson in the value of unity.
May I meet with you briefly to discuss my idea, which I am confident will not only improve the lives of those hearing and receiving the message, but will also serve as an excellent investment of public relations dollars for Enron?

Now, Now.  It's not MY kind of thinking that lead anywhere.  It's stupid
pledges with insufficient guidance from the leaders of the Auburn chapter
that lead to this discussion.  The Leaders of the Beta chapter should have
sent those guys packing immediately for their un-funny dress up.  But
remember when Ted Danson dressed in blackface when he was dating Whoopi
Goldberg?   The glitterati considered it poor taste and then dropped the
whole issue almost immediately.  I can't claim to know the Greek diversity
statistics at Auburn, so I don't pre-suppose that the Black Fraternity has
no whites, nor that the other national fraternities have no blacks.  I do
know that  campus life has changed considerably in 30 years, that
inter-racial dating and marriages are quite prevalent and the student bodies
and their organizations (including Greek) are reflective of those changes.
The point still remains that the Black Fraternity is as racial isolated, or
perhaps even more racially isolated, than probably any other campus
organization.  Perhaps that is why they take such offense at the Beta
stunt - maybe even more offense than the situation warranted.

a 3.28.!   I remember telling my Freshman math professor, in all

I have attached our Bear Stearns Stratis Program for your review as well.
Many execs are finding  access to these top money managers and lower fees,
without constant commissions very appealing.

Dear Jeff,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington, DC on October 3-4.  Ordinarily, I would be happy to
participate.  However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on
October 1.  Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.
Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.  Too bad.

On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me?  I would like to set something up with MIT's
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including
energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

Thanks

Paul

It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks 
just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!

I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe 
had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' 
house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football 
game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be 
able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night 
of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate 
aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.

That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, 
if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really 
appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to 
the football game Saturday.

Attached is a draft memo to Accenture walking through the big issues.  As it turns out, there were way too many changes in our draft to go through many of them in any detail, and the memo basically says ""We think this is a better approach and please don't blow up and go crazy until you have read the whole thing and thought about it"" -- but I still think it's useful to send it out.  Also attached is a suggested definition for ""Enron Platform"" --

Rosh, I'm sending over some hand-marked comments for your review -- one significant point is that I think we need a definition of ""Data Services"" that defines exactly what Accenture will do (reformatting Customer-Specific Transaction Data and providing it to Qualified  Customers in an electronic format, but not including mid-or back-office services (which we may also want to define) -- some of the provisions (like the exclusivity) will be easier to grasp if we have a term describing what Accenture will provide.

I will be out starting at 11:00 for the Legal Department PRC (maybe out for the rest of the day), so if we can talk before then to get this wrapped up, that would be great

I ran into Andy this morning at Enron.  He told that we had the contract
and I said I would expect to review/discuss the changes as soon as Mike and
team had assessed it.  I didn't get the sense that it was a rewrite, but if
that's the case, so be it.  I need you to give me a date as I am travelling

Andy,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, True Quote is in the process of
obtaining an equity bridge in the range of $1 to $2 million.  True Quote's
current cash position is tight and we need to complete this process within
the next two/three weeks.    Due to the current state of the capital
markets, management feels it is prudent to solicit a small bridge amount.
Once ""traction"" (EOL link complete, TQTS deal complete, etc..) is obtained,
we will continue to solicit larger equity investments from strategic
partners and the investment community.

I would be glad to discuss the current state of affairs in more detail and
provide the appropriate information if you are interested in pursuing this
opportunity.

We wanted to keep you in the loop on all of the Kiodex documents -- attached are copies of the Stockholders' Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Warrant Agreement that we are preparing to send out to Kiodex for their review (these incorporate our comments to Kiodex' drafts).  Our comments to these documents were consistent with the approach that we took in the HoustonStreet and TrueQuote deals.

This is actually the second round of comments that we are sending in -- this round of comments is to reflect the new structure that we needed to implement to get the desired accounting treatment, which we have already discussed with Kiodex.  Since it is just a follow up to comments we have already sent, we will probably go ahead and send them out to Kiodex, but there will be more than enough time to get any comments you may have in front of Kiodex as well.

Mike --

Per Drew's request, attached are the Stock Purchase Agreement, Warrant and Stockholder's Agreement for your review.  The final agreement, the Co-Marketing Agreement, will follow shortly.  As Drew may have mentioned, we would like to circulate these documents to Kiodex tonight, so it would be helpful to get your comments as soon as possible today.

Hope all is going well for you and your bride. I know I owe you a phone call, and I will pay the debt soon.

Chris,

Here is our status as of yesterday and answers to Richard's comments:

Primary issue:  4 to 5 second latency between Enron Stack/EnronOnline TEST changes to TrueQuote browser update. Updates from the Enron Stack to the True Quote interface bridge are instantaneous. 

Other issues:
1.  Products hit/lifted on Truequote do not show price/volume updates from EnronOnline after transaction is complete on EnronOnline.
2.  Multiple product activation results in a ""stepped"" display of products on Truequote browser as opposed to all at once on EnronOnline.
3.  EnronOnline sends a bundle of information (e.g. products activated, prices changed, etc.) to the Truequote server.  Truequote server takes longer to process the incoming data than the EnronOnline server will stay connected.  Truequote has possibly resolved this issue by sending an immediate response for all incoming data in order to prevent the EnronOnline server from cutting the connection.

Oracle error:	Kevin Meredith  forwarded the email containing the text for the Oracle error to Kenneth Lim at 7:21AM.  Kenneth responded with an answer as to why we were receiving the error for transaction attempts by 7:36AM.  I informed Stewart Clark as to the status of the issue surrounding the Oracle error in our first conversation at approximately 9:00AM.  Kenneth's response: Approximately 6:20pm Wed night, there was an update to the TEST database which caused this error, we resolved this error along with our internal EnronOnlineTEST site with the resynching of our servers.

Price Update on any transaction attempt: This has always been the case with EnronOnline to ensure the correct price is showing

Dear Ahmed,

	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with Khalid!
	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, Khalid will be a good sleeper.  I told Amy that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe Tony, Sam & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that Sam will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San Antonio (Tony's brother Larry's boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!
	Sam is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  Sam has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will Khalid be?  Sam is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.
	Everything else is good here.  My mom and Charlie have started driving here today.  They will get to Houston tomorrow night.  Tony is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.
	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that Sam knows my mom, Charlie, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that Sam will have the same.
	Have fun with sweet Khalid and take care of Amy.  It sounds like you all are doing great!

Love,
Lindy

It sounds like you've got your hands full.

Wait just a minute.  Don't Goodell and I get a wedding invite?  Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift!  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!   We are poorer than college students now.  I think you should send us an invite anyway.  Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it.  At least I could get drunk.  So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that?  I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway.  

Those are fantastic grades.  You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83, and I still think it would be a struggle.  I know you told me but I can't remember, whets is your major?  MBA?

Its good to hear about Alicia.  Is she going to grad school?

I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married.  We move in together at the end of Feb.  I'm nervous about that.  I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together.  I took some digital photo's of her yesterday.  I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be.

Ruth, remember that moorning you ""allegedly"" called me from Shemin's office last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin ""What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?"".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were ""covered"" with cheese and filled with ""chunks"" of ham

Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word?

Thanks for writing buddy.  Things are going very well on the home front.  Things began to improve after you and I had our little chat before Christmas and they have been improving ever since.  I really do appreciate it.
 
How's work at Enron?  Good question.  I started taking my vacation on the 27th.  I'm scheduled to be out until the 14th to use up all of my 2001 vacation.  I honestly believe some of us will be let go this week or next week.  But then its anybodys guess these days too.  I do check my emails from home and thats when I got your message.  There isn't anything to do at work right now.  I guess we should hear something this week.

Chris,

I think that it makes more sense if we send out our form to you.  We have no
problem w/ the changes to force majeure, but most of the other issues raised
in the GISB will present problems for us.  Specifically, we are unable to
agree to TX law, any arbitration, as well as spot price method of damages.
Additionally, it is of key importance to us that we have an order in place
w/ the bankruptcy court permitting both the contract, including the
transactions, and for Sempra to close-out and terminate any transactions in
the event that Enron converts its case to a Chapter 7.  We would require the
GISB to have language referencing such an order.

I will ask our Contract Administration group to send this out today.  I will
not be in the office this afternoon and tomorrow, but if you want we can
discuss on Friday.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.

I have validated the curve shift data against the official internal daily position and p&l reports (which report total p&l) and am generally comfortable with the original curve-shift numbers. The differences betweeen the two are due to the following components of profit and loss, i.e. those which price moves against a day's closing position do not capture:
 
1    Intra day positioning (in the forward and cash markets)
2    New deals against our mid curve
3    Liquidity and other reserve movements
4    Liquidation (i.e. where forward mark-to-market value drops out of the forward book and into cash)
 
The data set you have is the one we use to test the efficacy of our VaR models and I would be cautious in their use for predicting profitability. Hence total p&l is the best indicator since it includes all the value changes in the book. 
 
I imagine you are using some measure of return on risk to predict p&l (RoVaR, for example). We have done similar studies for presentation to our Board, amongst others. Let me know if this analysis would be useful to you - we would be happy to provide it.
 
Regards
David

Dear Rick,

I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you
about my Cash Balance Plan.  My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up
this Sunday, December 9.

The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that
HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right.  HR (Sheila Walton) told
me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we
will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid
severance.  With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable
now.  HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my
questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning.  Benefits
stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I
would vest.  HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is.
If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on
vacation and terminated after the 9th.

I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my
termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.  I feel
that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of
information and loads of unanswered questions. I do not see myself in a
position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up.

My contact information is:

SoCalGas is circulating a draft pre-hearing conference statement for parties to sign on to, if they wish (please see attached).  Given Transwestern's position in the BCAP, it makes sense to sign on to SoCalGas' generic PHC statement.  Please take a few moments to review the same and let me know your thoughts.

That sounds great. I would like to spend as much time with you as possible so come as early as you can and stay as late as you want. 

I actually thought the movie was pretty good. We'll see what we can come up with the next time. 

I'll try not to eat too much this week ( I have to look good for you!).

Take care.

Subject: BR/TW Window Rock Meeting Scheduled for Dec 3rd


Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks,

Lizzette, Michelle,

Thanks for the quick turnaround.  Per your notation in file 101lmp.doc, attached is a copy of the memo that was sent out by John Sheriff and Michael Brown.  There is an added piece where our Commercial and Commercial Support leads of the office added their bit.

Also, please note that the calculation in the separation calculator was off so I've corrected and attached here for your reference.  

Are we now waiting on Drew and Pat to come back with their comments of the documents?

Louis, Michelle, and Cynthia,

Attached in Word is PIC's revised Administration Agreement and Trust Accounting Agreement for your review.  The Administration Agreement states that PIC will provide third party administration and actuarial services to the Plan, including calculation of contributions, preparation of disclosures and annual reports, maintenance of day-to-day records, and enrollment and termination of participants.  The Trust Accounting Agreement states that PIC will handle the trust accounting for the Plan (please let us know if Enron prefers to use someone else for this task).

PIC has agreed to waive any charges for the GUST restatement of the Plan, which will be taking place later this year.

Note the following basic administration charges:

Initially:
$1,000 analysis, design, and consulting
$1,000 plan document & SPD
$   175 IRS submission fee (for volume submitter document)

Ongoing:
$1,200 annual administration
plus $25 per participant

Additional charges will apply, including nondiscrimination testing and actuarial computations at $150/hour.

If the agreements meet with your approval, GSP's HR Manager has already been authorized to sign any necessary documents.  Therefore, Louis should sign where indicated and return the originals to Kevin Glueck, Pension Investors Corporation, 3939 Hollywood Blvd., Suite 1A, Hollywood, FL 33021, along with a retainer of $2,000 for the initial design and plan document fees.  Please provide copies to us.

Please let us know if you have questions, or you may contact Kevin Glueck at PIC directly at 954-986-8688 ext. 210.

Thanks,
Ann

Andy and Michelle:  I am  still waiting to hear from Ann Murray (at LeBoeuf Lamb) about the results of the  ""410(b) test"" for the GSP pension plan.  (If the plan cannot pass that  test, it cannot be maintained in the Enron controlled group as drafted.)  I  called Ann again yesterday, and she is out of town until Tuesday, although she  left a message that the actuary should have the results of the test when she  gets back.  I am holding up the letter to Media General and the notice to  the trustee until I hear from Ann that all is ok.  If the test is not  passed, there are several alternatives, but I do not want to direct the trustee  to send the assets to the GSP plan until we are sure that it is the plan  that will receive the Media General assets.  I will let you know as soon as  I get word from Ann.  Let me know if you have any questions in the  meantime.  Dusty Burke.

Dear Gretchen:  

Wow!  You are thinking ahead!  What is a Leap Pad?  Is it something computer 
related? I have never heard of it.

On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice 
and hot by then.  We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while 
we are there, so that is good.  We got new furniture in the living room -- a 
chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.  It amplified the need 
for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we 
go!

Stay cool -- Michelle

Thanks, Alan.  I just got off the phone with the other candidate, Donald
Duncan, and he, too, appears strong.  Donald has been an in-house energy
lawyer in Houston for 24 years, most recently with Eagle Global Logistics
(EGL), an international freight forwarder, which he left in May.  EGL is
suffering severe financial problems which comes as no surprise since their
principal client base are the computer manufacturers and tech companies that
have all suffered dramatic losses over the past 3-5 quarters.

Notably, Donald spent 9 years with Pennzoil's mining business and, as such,
is intimately familiar with the coal industry.  He also worked on a major
coal seam degasification project for Sonat in the '80s in the Black Warrior
Basin of Alabama.

Donald has the advantage of being familiar with both the coal and freight
industries and of being already in Houston.  He is very interested in you
and, as with Jerry Prager, let me encourage you to call him directly if you
are interested in speaking with him.  He is available anytime after 2:00
p.m. today and anytime tomorrow morning.  He can be reached at 713.515.4863.

Of course, if you are interested in additional information, please feel free
to give me a call.  Best regards,

We think that we will be in Austin from Sunday to Tuesday.  We made plans 
yesterday to spend Sunday evening with some friends from law school.  At some 
point, I will have lunch with Maria Morris Stewart (my roommate from Tulane) 
who lives in Austin.  We still are free on Monday evening, if that works for

splurge for the Four Seasons -- no firm plans as of yet!!

Enclosed is an article in this morning's San Diego Union, written by one of 
their reporters that I know. As indicated, it focuses on Enron. Of particular 
interest are the comments by Senator Dunn, which are at odds with his 
statements to the Sacramento lobbyists that he has no idea what Enron does.

"Please conduct text continuation for the below context: 
A portion of the defense conference call today related to argument of the 
remand opposition. I reminded the group that you wished to argue. Apparently 
all three defendants who filed briefs will argue through counsel. Per the 
Order, defendants have one hour total to divide. It was agreed that it would 
be beneficial to have you, Jim Springer (Duke), and John Sturgeon (Mirant) 
caucus by telephone to iron out the details including time allocation, order 
of presentation, subjects to be covered, strategy etc. Other counsel are free 
to forward their thoughts as to likely questions etc. Chris Healy advised 
that he would like to be involved in your discussions on these points. 
Thereafter you would distribute argument outlines for review and comment by 
all. There will then be a Conference call involving the Defense Group on the 
preceding Friday 6/15 @ 9 A.M. to iron out any issues. Do you have any 
problems with this approach? I will leave it to you to coordinate these 
efforts with your calendar. If you want me to assist please let me know.

Defendants are still continuing in their position that Judge Whaley should 
defer these rulings until the MDL has acted. A letter to the Court to this 
effect is being delivered today. However we are proceeding on the assumption 
that the hearing will proceed on 6/18. Query what the impact would be if the 
M.L. assigned all cases to Judge Whaley prior to 6/18. Would this result in a 
continuance to permit the other remand issues to be heard all at once? I'll 
certainly advise you ASAP of any hearing date change.

Chris Boehler is the lawyer at A&K who handled the IDB Lease (the one that I gave you a copy of the other day).  Bill Neese is the lawyer for the IDB who worked across the table from Chris.  You might want to get Bill's number from Chris Boehler (Chris' direct lines is 713-220-4421) and give him a call.  I am sure that Bill is worried about who is covering his legal fees.  If memory serves me, the Lease calls for the IDB to be fully indemnified by the lessee (Gleason Power I, L.L.C.).  Please call if you need any further information.

John, just a couple of quick comments. 

First BP 9 is identified as an ""independent issue"" and BP 4 is identified as
a ""dependent Issues"", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I would think
both of these should be ""dependent"",  unless I am missing something.  I
guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is asking to be
worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West and East
proposal for each of these practices?  

Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common (nationwide)
Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or financial)?


Thanks John,

I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.
 
We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!

For your info-  I will be having a tailgate party both pre and post game, regardless of outcome.  It is located at 9th and S on the east side of 9th street towards the southwest end of the lot where there is a large billboard advertising a 30$$ ++  Jackpot ( at least that's what it had on last weekend)   Please feel free to have the group join in if you get there in enough time.

Danny, I am forwarding you this summary of two conversations last week in Calgary.  Also I believe Eric had a similar talk with Dennis in Houston.   I want to emphasize that in sending this message out I was simply acting as meeting secretary regarding what was said last week.  It is clear to me that Stan wants to call these shots.  Bob.

Danny,

To keep you updated, we are reorganising our Merchant Energy function
globally, and John Hushon, CEO of Europe (my direct boss) is leaving end of
the year.  As a result, I have put activated my own return to the US and it
looks like I will be moving to Jay Holm/Stan Babiuk's group as Director of
Project Development in Major Projects.  It could be fun, depending on how
much running room they will let me have.  It will be nice to get back up to
speed on the US side as well.

I'll be back in Houston effective January 1, and the family is moving end of
February.  It should be official by the end of the week, as soon as I get
some HR items nailed down.  Anyway, you know before most El Paso people do,
so please don't mention anything just yet.

Also, I know it's tough times right now.  Just wanted to let you know that
I'm praying for you and my many other Enron friends right now.  Hang in
there man.

I'll be in touch.

Chris,
    Could you please look at this?  We are trying to determine if we should pay this or not.  It appears we withheld payment from CDWR because of the PX short payment.  Do we need to call CDWR and tell them we are not going to pay until we collect from the PX?  Amy Clemons keeps talking about an annuity that needs to put in Enpower.  Stuart seems to have no idea what to do.  In any case, I am not sure what to do with this, can you shed some light on it.  Word.

Don't forget about simple supply and demand. During the period under

than the usual units were off (they don't work like slaves without some
problems) and the water flow/fish problems were affecting hydro i.e.
problem with supply. Input costs can not and should not be blamed for
everything.

Mary, Alan and Sue:

Although Enron is not part of either the DSTAR Power Marketer Coalition
or the RTOWest Power Marketer Coaltion, I am passing this on to you so
you will know what I would be advocating in RTOWest.  If you see
something problematic (which I doubt, since the DSTAR market monitoring
approach is pretty much a minimalist approach), let me know, so we can
sort out any possible differences privately.

Thanks,

Carl

Alan,
 While an open season is useful, I am not sure we need to require it in all 
instances.  If a developer of a generation project needs to build 
transmission to get its energy to market, they should be allowed to build it 
and get FTRs.  This presumes that the builder will have to negotiate the 
obstacle course associated with construction (environmental, reliability, and 
other siting approvals).  There are currently so many safeguards in place and 
building is so difficult, that any requirement for open season may well be 
generated when you try to use scarce right of way to build less than an 
optimal line.  This is exactly the debate going on in this committee, so as 
you say, the devil will reside at details.com.

Steve, Mary:

Other than stating that the ""devil is in the details,"" I am not sure I found 
this that illuminating.

Can I assume that we support giving whoever invests in transmission, any 
identifiable capacity (via FTRs) created by the expansion?  I also assume any 
expansion may need an open season type procedure to make sure the expansion 
is broadly distributed to prevent monopoly power ....

FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.

Best,

Sarah,
The Generation Interconnection Agreement will have to be modified to
accommodate the Net Metering law (R.C.W. Chapter 80.60) that was passed here
in Washington in 1998.  The law covers generators of 25 kW or less that are
powered by solar, wind, hydro or fuel cells.  Washington distribution
utilities are required to install two-way meters for all customers with such
facilities and to credit those customers for any power produced in excess of
the customer's needs.  We are required to accept all qualified net metering
customers until the total generating capacity of the net metered systems
reaches 0.1 percent of our 1996 peak load.

Because these generators are tiny and, even in the aggregate, are unlikely
to have any appreciable effect on the operation of the grid, I think the
easiest approach would be simply to write an exemption into the GIA for such
net metered generators.

I don't know whether any of the other RTO-West states have net metering
laws.  However, net metering has been kicked around quite a bit in
connection with federal restructuring legislation.  Hence, we need to keep
an eye developments in DC in this regard.

Bruce,

I need to hold the deliveries to 60,000 for 2/24.  I'm somewhat limited on
my transport right now.  I will look into the possibility of increasing the
volume, though.  If you can increase the deliveries at Fuels Cotton Valley,
that will work.

Very interesting.  We are coming to an inevitable point.  The industry wants 
a standard agreement.  Agreement is expressed in the singular.  There cannot 
be two standard agreements, it defeats the whole idea of set off  and 
consistency.  I see the Newport session as perhaps akin to Fort Sumter 
itself.  Somebody has got to step up to the big public plate and fire a 
massive broadside at the WSPP and get it started.  Only one can survive.  Or,

All of you have expressed an interest in having a collateral annex to use 
with the EEI Master Contract.  A small group began working on an annex last 
winter.  Bill McCoy from Morgan Stanley circulated a ""conceptual"" draft which 
was commented on by a few companies.  Due to the intervening California 
market crisis, the group did not undertake further work.  After our credit 
workshop in Atlanta in March, many of you have asked to bring the working 
group together in order to reach closure on the annex.    As a starting, 
point I've attached Bill McCoy's draft and the comments circulated to date.  
I suggest that we develop a strawman from these documents that would serve as 
the basis for a consensus document adopted at a drafting meeting during the 
summer.  Before that meeting we could collaborate via email and conference 
calls.  Reliant has agreed to host a meeting in July which would coincide 
with a meeting  of the EEI contract drafting committee.  No specific date has 
been set, but many in the drafting committee are leaning towards meeting 
after mid-July.     Please use the attached calendar to show dates you would 
be unavailable in July so we can set a date.  Please fax this to Patricia

in my opinion of course.  Please review and comment if you would like to

As you know,  I will  be question frequently regarding the status of this

For our call this afternoon.  This is very helpful.  I ta slo sounds complicated, but I think you will se that absent a perfect world, Robert is suggesting only minor changes to the set-off clause previuosly circulated by Mark for EWS trading contracts.  Roberts has also attached more fully developed provisions for both triangular set-off and for square set-off (which would be applicable under the Master Netting and Collateral Contract) which address the issues of mutuality, privity and consideration in greater detail.

I rent a small cottage in the Heights and have lived in the Heights for the
past 8 years.  I love it for the very reasons Jeff Balke has stated.  I also
love not having to get on the freeway to drive to work every day - I used to
live in Kingwood.  I don't want to see huge townhomes built on every
available property because ten years from architectural styles will change
again and some of this new construction will appear even more ugly than it
is now.  Just my opinion.

Subject: RE: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings



Jeremy, 

Thanks for stepping up and taking the WSPP bull (no pun intended) by the horns. I am going to discuss with Elizabeth Sager, throwing our support behind the FERC filing.  I am personally 100% behind the idea, and will urge Elizabeth to support it too.  We will communicate in a more official sense with you soon.  You seem to be taking a broad, big picture, very reasonable approach to the process issue.  This is long overdue.   I like the way you suggested how there might be a place for a persuasive, rather than academic memo about the convergence issue,  or ""creeping imitation"" as I think it is best characterized.  I will begin to write such a memo and ask for your help in fitting it into the process in the most productive way as this strange process continues to unfold.  Thanks again for your efforts and we will get back to you in more detail soon. ----cgy

Yes, I liked him a lot.  I wish he were more conveniently located, and that
he was on my insurance network.  I've got to go out of network if I keep
seeing him.  I have a pediatrician close by and I like her, but she's new
out of her residency and doesn't know as much as Injac does.  He had a lot
more information to give me on several items I had talked to her about.
Where are you going?  Vacation, I hope.
Connor has mommyitis.  He doesn't want me to ever leave him - and it's too
restrictive.  Our 2 day a week nanny went on vacation for 2 weeks and now
he's upset if she has him.  How quickly they change.  I guess that's the
good news also.
My phone # is 832-358-1543 (they wouldn't give me a 713 number, to my
surprise).  Oh well, there are worse things than having a difficult phone
number.
See you soon maybe.

I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if 
the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While 
Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those 
counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if 
we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely 
will eventually make the EEI contract the ""default"" contract if there are no 
other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any 
assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.

This is operational stuff I received from the Power Pool.  

I seem to be receiving a lot of this kind of stuff and I think it is now appropriate for Enron to change our designated contact person with the Power Pool from me to someone who is more operationally focused.  Please let me know who you want to do that and I will advise the Power Pool of the change.

Ken-Here is a first cut at a spread sheet for the distributions necessary to
return at lease $100,000 to everyone so no partner will have to put up any
new money.  Have you heard from Texaco or BFI? Also, Marathon committed to
the roll over, but not the referendum.  You may need to make a call to
Marathon to see if you can convince them on the referendum.  Conoco also
only committed to their proportionate part, probably about $50,000, for the
referendum and Don Sanders said he would commit $50,000 toward the
referendum.  We, therefore could have only $1 million from the partners on
the referendum if Marathon, Texaco and BFI don't contribute.  We do have
$100,000, however, from Reliant.  Moreover, without Sanders, BFI and
possibly Texaco, we may have only around $30 million to rollover into the
loan.  As soon as we can the final answers from all of the partners we will
be able to finalize the term sheet with the Sports Authority and get the
advance payment on the loan.  I still haven't heard from Goldberg on the
term sheet with the Rockets.

Mark your calendars!  Pack your bags!  Gas up the car!  The next Girls' 
Weekend is scheduled.

When:  April 12 - 14
Place:  Marble Falls, Texas

Let me know by return e-mail if you think you can come.  I'll get back with 
you on all the specifics (driving directions, what to bring, and that ever 
important topic - FOOD and WINE).  If you'd like to spend a bit longer in 
Marble Falls, Phyllis can accommodate Thursday arrivals and Monday 
departures.  Just let me know so we can reserve your bed.

Some members of the group have been having a difficult time lately, so let's 
all get together and be supportive of each other.  For all mobile members of 
the group, some shopping in Fredricksburg is available on Saturday.

Looking forward to seeing all of the you,
Janell

P.S.  Should your e-mail address suddenly change (for whatever reason!), be 
sure to keep in contact with me (phone 501-922-4133).

Hello Girls--
I just wanted to let you all know how excited I am that we will be getting together again!  Janell tells me almost everyone has accepted the invitation.  This is going to be fun and there's plenty of room for everyone.  However, I don't have 10 beds!!!!   So if anyone has an air mattress they could bring that would be great.  

We planned on going out to dinner Friday night and anyone arriving by 7pm is welcome.  For those of you arriving later, we'll leave the light on for you and the front door open.  (Don't worry I live in very safe neighborhood--lots of retired folks!!!)   

Below is a map with directions to my house and my home phone number.  

I look forward to seeing you all!

This is going to be fun and there's plenty of room for everyone.  However, I don't have 10 beds!!!!   So if anyone has an air mattress they could bring that would be great.  

We planned on going out to dinner Friday night and anyone arriving by 7pm is welcome.  For those of you arriving later, we'll leave the light on for you and the front door open.  (Don't worry I live in very safe neighborhood--lots of retired folks!!!)   

Below is a map with directions to my house and my home phone number.  

I look forward to seeing you all!

Paul,

Guess that makes you the baddest bull in the pasture [now you've got to deal
with all those admiring cows].

You ought to take the kids to Dallas for indoctrination as the Longhorns win
the Big XII championship again.

We're still not walking up here, but there was some excitement when Janell
got a right shoe on [not for long].  I'm very concerned at this point about
our mini-Imelda investment in ladies footwear and the Docs lack of expressed
confidence about the swelling ever subsiding totally.  It's hell to be old
{Janell tells me}.

Oh well, at least we're not all working for bankrupt companies...

Thanx,
Dennis

Thanks, Ann!  You and Matthew have a great holiday, too...

On 12/16, Kim and I have an obligation with the Spires, our annual holiday
party with a twist:  we are honoring the Spires' staff for their dedication
during and after last summer's flood.  Since I'm chairing (and somehow got
talked into emceeing) the event, I think I need to be there.  That event
starts at 5:30 and should be over by 8:30 or 9, so if your party is still in
progress, we'll be there!

Since we were together Tom checked the website for the New Orleans Wine and
Food Experience.  Tom discovered it is now held in May.  The 2002 program is
up and gives all the details. The dates are May 22 - 26, 2002.  If you wish
to check it out here it is: http://www.nowfe.com/ . After you have a chance
to consider it, perhaps we can decide as a group whether we want to take
this on, either in whole or in part.
We will get back to you later on our available dates for January.

We also will use some time at this week's workshop to inform the
participants about new issues various parties have identified since the
first workshop on September 14.

Bottom-line SBX 9 is a big step forward? in deploying clean  distributed 
generation. 
?
There  are always specific elements/details, which?might have been done  
differently, but I do believe most of us agree that this is a very positive 
step  for California and it will significantly help the State in the very 
challenging  energy situation it is facing.

Cameron and Scott -- that's great!!!
And Congratulations also to all you non-smokers!

Ken and I are looking forward to seeing all of you but we aren't sure
exactly when or how long we'll be dropping by. On a total whim, we bought a
cute (although a bit funky) little house up in Ft. Bragg last October. Our
main goal over Memorial Weekend is going to be to build a new staircase for
that house, but we're hoping to make it down to the dome Sunday early
evening. If not that, then we'll definitely show up for the softball game on
Monday. My Dad, the sweetheart, is coming out to help with this project on
his way up to the San Juan Islands and I know he's excited about getting to
experience a piece of 'The Dome' as well. Sarabeth is going to Greece for a
couple of weeks, so she's going to miss all the fun, poor thing. Anyway,
we'll be sure to bring champagne for all the celebratory causes and
See you all soon!

We can also meet at my meager apartment.  Parking is difficult, although,
there is one spot on the sidewalk in front of my house that the
neighborhood
has deemed a legal spot.  Do you have parking Jeff?

Either is fine with me!

"Please conduct text continuation for the below context: 
If we are still open to changes I would suggest adding a sentence (in
brackets below) to the paragraph about retail competition that supports a
reasonable proposal by the ISO  market survailence committee. We all hope
that the market will do it anyway but in a disfunctional market certain
things need to be mandated.


"".....Second, California should not abandon its goal of fostering retail
competition.  New competitors need the ample, stable and reliable
electricity supplies that a reformed market system will promote.  Retail
competition can help bring new types of contracts and metering systems, and
better awareness of environmental effects as entrants introduce ""green""
packages, and demand-side innovations.  This is another reason why consumers
must pay the real cost of electricity, as retail competition cannot thrive
in an environment in which supply companies lack retail pricing freedom.  As
a consequence, companies involved in retail supply, including the California
utilities, should be allowed to pass-through their energy costs in a
competitive environment. [At the same time retail customers should be
guaranteed the option of locking in a fixed fair price by the default
supplier and not be exposed to market volatility should they choose to do
so.]

Finally, oversight of the electricity business will always be needed.  The
cornerstones of electricity regulation must be oversight of the distribution
function, and ensuring that any anticompetitive behavior by suppliers is
circumscribed. ""

Hi Jeff-
Howz it going?  Long time no see - we need to do a happy hour so that we can
catch up!  Hope you had a blast at the Resort at Squaw of couple of weekends
ago.  Wasn't it a gorgeous weekend!

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list
of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question
around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a
similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him.

If you have already called him, don't worry about it.  If not, go ahead and
we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish.  Just let me know
who you pick on my list!

Take care,
Deepika

I am visiting Haas this year and will be teaching 'European Financial
Markets' (BA 296-7, E 296-5) in the spring. Since this is a new course,
I thought I should draw it to your attention. The move to monetary union
(EMU) in Europe has created a newly integrated financial area comparable
to the US, with consequences that anyone doing business or advising
businesses in Europe needs to understand. Just consider:

'The dollar's supremacy has been challenged in the global debt markets.'
(FT, 6/14/99).  'The large funds have indulged in a frenzy of
cross-border buying...with the volume of paper launched by European
companies rising five-fold over 1998.' (FT 10/28/99)   '...a doubling of
European-based staff at Lehman Brothers, a 50% increase at SSB, and up
to 20% at other banks...follows Europe overtaking the US in M&A
activity...' (FT 10/25/99)

I shall address questions such as: How does the European Central Bank
differ from the Fed? Will the euro compete with the dollar as an
international currency? Can European capital markets challenge the US
for international portfolio managers and for non-European issuers? Will
Europe soon have serious venture capital and junk bond sectors? Will the
European banking sector experience a deep wave of cross-border
restructurings? Will there be a shift from domestic to cross-border M&A
in Europe - and will competition authorities try to restrain it? How
will the East European emerging markets fit into the picture?

If these issues interest you, I look forward to seeing you in January.

Hello Environmental and Energy Committee Members:

Please see the following request from Dr. Kenneth Lim of the BAAQMD.  The
information he seeks is in support of a petition for additional State
funding for BAAQMD programs.  I understand how short the notice is, but if
you can provide Dr. Lim some information, I think he and the BAAQMD would be
very appreciative.  If you would like to send me your data, I will forward
it to Ken Lim without your company information.

Sincerely,

Margaret Bruce
Director, Environmental Programs

Jeff,

Sorry for the delay in responding.

As for initiatives.  I have a VERY tentative product roadmap that plots the
Perfect course for the next 12-18 months.  Here's what I've come up with so
far.

Keep in mind that anything past V2.0 is a pure WAG.  Also, if you have any
questions about any of the specific features, just let me know and I'll try
to explain.

Also keep in mind that the name so companies mentioned for the integration
pieces is only tentative.  These are companies we are working with but have
NOT finalized any formal agreements as yet.

Regards,

Mike D.

This is SDG&E's facilitation proposal.  Comments are due tomorrow, 8/1.  The 
only thing that looks concerning to me is the attachment to the advise 
letter, page 4, paragraph f, which talks about an obligation to serve any 
customer within the designated group that is willing to post a 3-month 
security deposit.  As our group is now defined in the advice letter as 20 kW 
and above, we may want to either suggest further segmentation of the group or

Shaka man

Hope you are having a good time.  Things did indeed move out of control sooner than anyone could have imagined.  Its been one heck of an experience watching the situation and learning about how leadership works and how markets can make you and destroy you.

As to what next, my first idea is to just take time off and chill out for a few weeks and then see what to do next.

Talk to you soon

Hi Roy
 
 
Good to hear from you.  I am glad to hear things are going well. This consolidation in the markets and the economy has been quite severe. I can tell you it has not been fun working with a 50 multiple company either as the p/e contracts to 7.  But nevertheless this had been interesting times.  
 
We ramped down DealBench in good time. It was a good decision and precipitated some good thinking. Practically, everyone moved out of ecommerce. Its just crazy when you think how things were 18 months ago. . Power trading has been immensely interesting. I am running the options desk and we have had a decent year.  Energy trading is fascinating and coupled with my macro background from bond trading,it becomes lot of fun.
 
Say hi to Loreli. Do let me have your Hong Kong phone number.

Tom,

I like the air too.  Polling our board, they are spit on which pool but as
Jeff pointed out the kids can start from the starting blocks instead of the
bulkhead (which does affect their times).  That was an issue for several
teams when we were setting up a Klein Oak last year.  We should all talk
about whether to request the gym and the additional cost of doing so.  The
pool fees have increased since last year.  You can shoot an email to Jeff
and the other teams about the idea if you like.

I am sorry that you are having problems with Shanna.  I am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like Shanna feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.

To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of uncertainty with the Dynegy and Enron merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let everything else work itself out.

I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably about bed time.

Thanks for writing to me.

Love,

Lowery is doing some more training in San Marco, about 45 minutes north of San Antonio.  I imagine he was staying on the River Walk so he had something to do with Kim.  If he had any balls at all he'd stick around for the weekend.

You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a 30-35%
discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go to the
Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.  I
have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll get a
range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and expensive
type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.

and we need to have an executive committee meeting in advance of the
September 10 meeting of the Board of Trustees.

At the Thursday meeting, we'll create a schedule for executive committee
meetings for the year, as well as establish a time and place for the
meetings which is mutually convenient.

Last year, the committee met once a month on Wednesdays at the Bayou Club
which proved to work well for everyone.

Please let Cheryl know if you will be able to attend Thursday's meeting.
You may reach her at 713 284 8253 or by email to bliss@camh.org.

Thanks and I hope to see you Thursday.

H Robert,

Sorry for the delay, however you know it has been very busy these last several weeks at Enron.  Unfortunately, we are not hiring, and won't be for the foreseeable future.  It would be best if we could schedule a phone call sometime during December when I will have more time to help.

Regards,

Jeff

Dear Kite and Key Alumni:

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our letter this past
summer.  The Kite and Key Executive Board is excited to have such an
active group of alumni who are interested in establishing a Board of
Governors!  To become acquainted with one another, we would like to
invite you to a Kite and Key Homecoming Reception that will occur after
the Penn-Princeton football game on Saturday, November 3rd.  The
gathering will be held in the Sweeten House, 3533 Locust Walk,
approximately at 4:00.  Attending the reception will be many current
Kite and Key students, as well as other Penn Alumni, with whom you can
speak.  For those of you who are interested, we hope to informally and
individually gather your ideas and visions of an Alumni Board of
Governors.  Food and drinks will be served.

To keep you updated on the most recent Kite and Key news and programs,
we have attached the Fall 2001 Newsletter that was distributed at our
first General Meeting in September.  Inside, you will find information
about the exciting initiatives that each of our projects hope to achieve
in the coming months.

We hope that you can attend the reception during Homecoming weekend.  If
you believe you will be able to join us, please RSVP to

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the ""e mail"" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

We already have an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with ENA, which continues on a month-to-month basis since the original one-year term expired on 11/1/01.  I assume that the Spot agreement would enable us to buy/sell interruptible gas, but it also seems to cover firm purchases.

Would the Spot agreement take the place of the Firm agreement?  If not, would having both agreements in place create any overlaps or conflicts?  How would we know which agreement applied to a particular transaction?  (For example, I don't see a netting provision in the Spot agreement, which is something that we would insist upon.)

Please let me know how the agreements would relate to one another.  In the meantime, I will begin to review the Spot agreement in greater detail.

Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of ""Financial
Portfolio Managment"" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some
type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I
told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you knew
anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks
buddy.

Yes I think my position would still be maintained if the trade group is acquired, however, I don't know if that is a definite thing.  I have heard that one company that is bidding on us (I don't know which one) would want to cut 250 more people.  Who knows who those people will be.  I just keep thinking about the retention bonuses and I was not one of the lucky recipients, so what keeps a company from coming in and keeping only the people that were deemed important in the first go round.  Also, if I find another oppurtunity what would make me stay here when I get overlooked in the area of importance (retention bonuses).  I want to work with John Arnold and Mike Maggi as long as I can because I think I could learn alot more from them, but I do not want to work for people that don't see my importance, does that make since?  I am not trying to treat this like grade school or anything, but I think I add alot to the group and I know that there are places that would see that and reward me for that.  Anyway, I am here for now.  

I think I told you but maybe not, I have an offer from Tractebel.  It is a good offer but not a great one.  I have to think about it.  Have you talked to them?  Have you talked to Fairley?  If not, you need to, they are beefing up.  Also, RWE, have you talked to them?  You need to talk to them as well.  Let me know if I can help in any way.

I would love to play golf with you anytime.  Just let me know, I can leave here pretty much whenever I want.  Also have a wonderful time in Florida, have a few drinks for me, make a few double bogeys for me and chase a few women for me.  Call me anytime, my home number is (713) 527-8743 and work is (713) 853-6247.

Good Luck and I look forward to talking to you.

I am glad you are moving out.  I think it will be really good for you.  To have the freedom that you need.  I am jealous.  I hope to be able to spend some time over at you new place.  

I just want you to know that you are very special to me and I really enjoy our time together even if it is short.  I enjoy talking to you and emailing you.  Of course I enjoy the other stuff but your company is what is very special.  Thanks for being there when I need someone to talk to or to hug or whatever.

Well, I guess I will get back to work.  See you soon.

Working Group will take place at ISDA's European office in London on Monday,
18th June at 4.00 p.m., London time (11 a.m., New York time).  Telephone
conference facilities will be provided for those who cannot attend the
meeting (details to be circulated in due course) but, as always, attendance
in person is encouraged.

The purpose of the meeting will be to try to finalise the terms of the
Bridge that takes an ""agreement"" (rather than a ""transaction"") approach.

I attach both a clean and a marked-up version of the latest draft of the
Bridge, together with some slides I used at a recent meeting of ISDA's
European Energy and Developing Products Committee, and the minutes for that
meeting.

Please let my secretary, Anna Elia (aelia@isda-eur.org
<mailto:aelia@isda-eur.org> ), know if you plan to attend the meeting.

Kind regards,
John.

Mark can we put togethr a term sheet for the below deal. I think it would be 
along the lines of a licensing agreement to use a version of EnronOnline that 
allowed Natsource to transact with Enron on the behalf of various 
counterparts. The transaction attempt would identify who they were attempting 
to transact on behalf of. The deal would be a one year deal @ 200K payable 
upon delivery of the application.

Let's discuss.

Hello Kimberly and Emily, 
I agree that the Euro provisions should be separated from the other group of proposed annexes to the protocol because the Euro subject matter relates to practical issues which must be addressed by the Jan. 1 deadline.  The majority of the other annexes relate to substantive and material changes to the way many existing provisions of the 1992 Master Agreement work (except for, among other things, the Force Majeure provisions which are mostly not addressed in the 1992 Master Agreement. . . . . a possible reason for separating the Force Majeure annex from the rest).  As far as the annexes which would make substantive changes to current provisions of the 1992 agreement, I understand from your email that ISDA is now proposing to role them into a ""new"" master agreement rather than issuing them in protocol form.  Would it not be a good litmus test to judge the acceptance by the ISDA membership (and otherwise) of each of the proposed annexes by issuing them in protocol form in order to see who and how many sign up for them?
Thank you.

The pool will be starting this Thursday, 8/30 and running through 11/24.  Try to pay up asap ($100 each).  Either give the money to me or Derek Wilson.  

The official rules are as follows:

1. The lines for all games other than Thursdays will be Danny Sheridan's from the Friday edition of the USA Today, for the Thursday games the lines will also be Danny 	Sheridan's but from the Thursday edition of the USA Today.  These are the only games you can choose from.

2. You must pick 5 different games a week against the spread in rule # 1 and assign priorities of 5,4,3,2,1.  In other words the game you are most sure of you would assign 	a 5 priority, and least sure of assign a 1 priority.  The priority selections of the games you win are totalled up to determine your weekly score.  For example if your 	priority 4 and priority 2 game cover the spread for the week and the 5,3, and 1 do not then you will have a weekly score of 6 (4 + 2).

3. All picks must be in by 2:00pm on Thursday for Thursday games and 2:00pm on Friday for weekend games.  Send your selections to ",enronsportsbook@yahoo.com

Subject: Summer Intern Program




I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   

 

Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

I wanted to take a moment and wish you and Carrin the best for the holiday
season.  Goodness knows we have all had an extraordinary '01-- I am guessing
this has been a year unlike any other for you and your family.  Here's to a
very healthy and happy '02.

Let's get together in the new year when you have a moment to focus on your
personal matters. Until then, should you need anything please let me know.

j-i've seen several articles recently re enron and india and have thought of
you. in some ways it's hard to realize that one of us is involved in a
matter of such great significance in the affairs of a major world power.
what would jim roach think. i hope that all continues well with you and your
family. it's hard, i know, when work and travel are so demanding; but as we
have discussed on numerous occasions there is no substitute for family and
friends. i've little to report in the way of any interesting reading
recently; i've been spending time on books relating to bioethics and spanish
literature[actually, il've taken a liking to spanish mysteries; although
i've run out of our friend perez-reverte and am getting involved in some
suggested by my spanish teacher]. deborah and i are immersing ourselves in a
serious summer program of hiking and gardening and just enjoying our time
together; it's a great feeling to have lived with someone for 30+ years and
discover new and wonderful things.  hopefully you'll find occasion to share
a hike with us this

James: I hope you were not offended when I wrote to you directly several
weeks ago (without introduction) about my hopes to talk to you about a
transactional lawyer position on your team.  Might you need another
hardworking, big firm trained lawyer with lots of complex outsourrcing and
transactional experience?  I think my training and experience would suit me
well to hit the ground running. I would be thrilled with the chance to
talk. Let me know and I can resend my resume. Look forward to talking soon.

thanksgiving, i went and delivered food for meals on wheels with Oma, and
then ate with my family.  it was really nice.  the girls are so grown up

Hi Eric 

I told your Mom we would decide on my visit after all the wedding festivities are overwith.  I'm sorry I can't make it to the wedding but I have a few loose ends to clear up since my last day of work here is January 31.  I'll spend time with all of you when I visit.  I'm looking forward to it. 

The weather here is cold and blustery.  We had 14"" of snow on January 6 but most of that is gone now.  We are to get snow showers over night but they only predict around an inch for the morning. 

Hi to Shanna and keep in touch. 

Love  Aunt Bonnie

Hi Aunt Bonnie,
 
It is great to hear from you.  We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.  Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.  We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried. It should be good.
 
On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.  We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.  I am looking forward to it.  
 
When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?  How is the weather treating you up there?
 
It was nice to hear from you.
 
Love,

Eric

John,

As far as supplying ENA, there are opportunities to do deals immediately:  ENA continues to supply all of its in-the-money contracts by purchasing energy from counterparties on a pre-pay basis.  The contract is under the WSPP.  Call Mallory (3811) to sell in California, Crandall (3815) or Scholtes (3807) for NW, and Salisbury (3910) for SW.  If you have any legal questions, call Dale Rasmussen (8863).

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a

June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -

it would be quite nice.   -c.

Yes - let's plan on my house on Sunday.  I have to leave for the airport 
after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much 
easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

Please see the attached correspondence between Stephanie Panus of Enron and

Now that I have it, I am expediting the process of obtaining the Apostille

Sara,

My understanding is that Legal has not provided feedback regarding the issue 
of notice in connection with online trading sites.    As noted in my email 
below related to the Buy Side Direct agreement:  

Section 12 of the attached Subscriber Agreement appears to specify who will 
receive notice only in the case of default by Enron.  How will legal and / or 
trading receive other notices - i,e, changes to the agreement ?

This issue has been outstanding for months.   When will Legal provide 
feedback on this issue ?

Thanks.

"Please conduct text continuation for the below context: 
I just spoke to Rick Borden (Royal's counsel).  We went through some of the 
documentation status and his view on how his documents will look.

He will be providing us today with an Acknowledgement Agreement to be 
executed by Enron.  This will acknowledge the assignment of the BF Equity 
documents as security for its credit obligations and will include the 
increased costs indemnity.  His initial draft will use fairly standard 
increased costs language which we can mark-up as required to make more 
palatable for the accountants.

We discussed generally the acceleration on illegality under the BF Equity 
credit agreement.  Still waiting for direction from the business people on 
this.

He also indicated that he would be drafting the Interest Rate Swap.  The 
non-standard features of this will be the adjustment mechanism which they 
propose will apply on Sched II's coming into the syndicate, and on a 
mandatory rollover from BAs' to prime which would occur if there is no market 
for BAs', if it becomes illegal to issue BAs' or if there is a default in the 
credit agreement where such default emanated from Enron (eg. non-payment).  I 
don't think this has been discussed previously and needs to be considered 
from both the business and accounting side.

Other documents:
His form of opinion will be coming today.
The Bank is doing the fee letter and will be distributing today.
Blakes will distribute our forms of opinions today.

If any of the above is problematic we should follow up with the Bank and/or 
its counsel this morning.

Sara:

Pursuant to our telephone conversation with Ron Rencher this afternoon, 
attached hereto for your review and comment is a revised draft copy of the 
form of legal opinion to be issued by outside counsel to Deseret Generation & 
Transmission Co-Operative (the ""Counterparty"").  The attached document is 
formatted in MS Word for Windows 97.

We talked on the telephone about a letter or opinion regarding the 
Counterparty being subject to the Utah Nonprofit Corporation and Co-operative 
Association Act (the ""Utah Nonprofit Act"") and the Counterparty having  
authority under the Utah Nonprofit Act and its Articles of Incorporation and 
Bylaws to enter into the Confirmation and perform the Transaction.  In that 
regard, the attached form of opinion requests those opinions from the 
Counterparty's outside counsel (see paragraphs 1, 2 and 3).  I think  the 
Counterparty's outside counsel is in a much better position to give Enron 
these opinions, and, I believe, its counsel should be able to give those 
opinions with a minimum amount of research and due diligence.

Please convey any comments or questions you may have at your convenience.

Happy New Year to  you and your family!  I hope you all had a lovely Christmas & New Year.   
 
I ate too much and  didn't drink enough because I wanted to be able to drive and visit people.   The first drink I had was New Year's Eve, my mum and I went over to my brother  & his girlfriend in Hayes (I DROVE & MY MUM SURVIVED!).   We went out for a meal and stayed the night so I could have a drink.   It's the first New Years my brother and I have ever spent with our mum so  it was very nice.
 
I'd love to see some  pictures of little Scott's first Christmas.
 
Take care & all  the best for 2002

It was good talking with you today.  Please find attached a map giving
general directions to our office complex.  Note that there are several
buildings in the Westlake Complex, so best directions to find us at the
right building are:

Exit I-10 west at Eldridge Parkway
Left on Eldridge under I-10, following Eldgridge to first light (Memorial
Drive)
Right on Memoria to first light (Westlake Park Blvd.)  [do NOT turn left
before the light at a BP building..that is a different office than ours]
Righ on Westlake Park and right again at the first entrance into the greyish
building complex (Westlake One)....go under breezeway and park in visitors'
area.  Go to reception just under the breezeway, and ask for me...we will
have to come and get you.  They may have trouble reaching me at my office
extension, so in case either they or you may have to call my cell number
below.

Not sure - I can't plan that far ahead at the moment.  We are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business I work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy - I work for a company called Enron which has gone bankrupt.  We have just sold the trading piece to UBS so we are in the process of transfer and I have no idea what the new bosses will be like.

Are you going?

Stuart,

Per our discussion of earlier this afternoon, I am forwarding a series of e:mails that contain the latest drafts of the three principal documents--the SPA, the Asset Management Agreement, and the Brokerage Agreement--as well as the Schedules & Exhibits to the SPA.  The SPA and the Schedules/Exhibits are ENA's latest drafts and the other two documents are AIG (Milbank Tweed's) responses.

Heather Kroll and I plan to meet at Bracewell tomorrow morning at 9:00a.m.  The AIG/Milbank folks are expected to arrive around 10:00, and we believe you could provide valuable input should you be in a position to attend on such short notice.  

As you will see from the Milbank markups a number of significant issues remain.  For example, their addition of (ii) to Section 8(c) of the Brokerage Agreement shows that AIG has yet to agree that ECT Securities liability for performance defaults should be limited to termination. 

Its going to be an interesting week.  Glad to have your insight.

Steve

Fred- as per our conversation, can you give me the name of a UBS person who can help me set up space in one of the two NYC UBS offices.  I will handle the details.
 
Moving forward, I'd appreciate if all requests related to Enron's business in NY be directed to the Senior person (me) who has been successfully running the business here for a year and a half.

I spoke with Michelle last night and from our perspective we are OK with you going ahead today with the severance packages. I presume Louise or John have had a chance to look at names and the overall severance number.
 
Dawn, you need to make sure Peter has checked severance calc logic, I have no way of checking whether this is reasonable. Obviously it is better than we have been able to do for people let go here and in London (which in of itself is not a concern presuming Peter/Rob agree it's reasonable and in line with what other companies have done up there).
 
On retention, I need to see list of proposed numbers. Ideally I'd like to have these paid with the other in Houston we are hoping to pay in the coming weeks. I need to discuss with Louise/John whether they agree it is OK to go ahead and do the Canadian ahead of time. In theory I agree.

What a neighborhood!!  The pictures were wonderful.  I knew I wouldn't have any trouble printing the .jpg files, but I was surprised how easy it was to print from the .pdf file.  Each picture was a page.  I'm explaining that this is a test case: we want to see if District D can solve problems for us.  Ada Edwards has a great idea to set up a little neighborhood office next to the storefront police station.  I'm willing to help, but only if we can get results.  We don't need a public relations gimmick.

Ed,
Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the
line runs down the west side of Montrose Blvd. and then west on Peden.

The owner is Jack Blalock, who owned BackSttreet Caf?, plus some other

He wss only about 50 or so.

The scoop on Clark Gable is, ss I recall, that he was here for aprt of a
summer while taking dancing lessons at that house, where he lodged, as well.
Hr wss only here a short whiler, but locals sre so proud of that fact that
they have called the charming stucco three-story, two-rooms-on-each-floor

Dear Julie,

I don't know if this is in time or not. We just got back from camping 
at Enchanted Rock for the long weekend (the kids were off school 
today).

We had our protest hearing for our set-back application on 9/20
before the Planning Commission. There was one property owner
who protested our application, so we had to go to the public hearing.
The short story is that our application was approved and forwarded 
on to City Council, the last step in the process before Peden is
protected from building closer to the street than the average of the 
existing buildings. We applied from Montrose to Taft on both sides 
of Peden. The Planning & Development Dept. (P&DD) records showed 
that we had 76% in favor, and most of the remaining 24% we couldn't
locate to ask to sign before we turned it in. There were two properties
that we slated to be demolished and converted to new townhouses.
With the new set-back in place, new construction is still allowed and
there are no other restriction placed on properties. We're just one step 
away from being protected for 20 years. The guy who protested said
he was planning to tear down two adjacent single story bungalows 
and build townhouses on the double lot. Mike Yates was the co-
applicant, but there was a lot of support and 20% of the signatories 
showed up at the protest hearing! Sorry if this is disjointed, but
I'm really tired from our backpacking and climbing.

Hope this is in time! Let me know if there are any questions.

Carmen

I want to hear that you are coaching, or maybe that you aren't coaching but
you are going to start working hard on becoming a better ball player.  What
we need is a good team mom.  Do you think you could stop off before each
game and pick up some snickers and sodies.  Each player gets to pick the
drink and candy each week and then you go get the stuff.

Hope to see you there.  Just in case, my cell phone number is 713-419-0111.

Attached is the ""term sheet"" with some suggested revisions (identified by
strikethrough and underlining).  We suggest that you simply call the ""late
charges"" interest rather than any other term.  This type of business
transaction is exempt from the usury statute in terms of any maximum rate
and thus it is best to make it clear that the late charge is ""interest""
rather than something else.  The other changes I made were merely to
clarify the method of calculating the interest on overdue amounts.  I note
the the contract you provided does include a provision for interest on
overdue invoice amounts.  Under the contract, interest is the Citibank
prime rate.  I assume you will set this term sheet up as an amendment to
the agreement.

Kay, John Klauberg forwarded your email requesting a ""fatal flaw"" review 
under Connecticut law and also your question relating to the granting of a 
security interest under the agreement.  The agreement does not appear to have 
any ""fatal flaws"" with respect to enforceability under Connecticut law.  
There are no liquidated damages provisions or ""sole"" remedy provisions that 
are often times problematic.  The contract does contain a rather extensive 
force majeure provision which we have not fully analyzed under Connecticut 
law, but the provision appears to be reasonably drafted and should not be a 
problem.  If you would like, we can take a closer look at it for precedents 
under Connecticut law.

As to the granting of the security interest and the filing of financing 
statements, we think that these provisions are reasonable for this type of 
contract and merely provide the seller with a mechanism for perfecting its 
security interest.  I have attached a memorandum that addresses this issue 
under Connecticut law.  Please call me at the number set forth below if you 
have any questions regarding this email or the attached memorandum, or if I 
may be of any other assistance.

Here are my observations:

I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I 
agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk 
for a performance problem.

Is the reference to the ""State"" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?

As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a 
confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my 
opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.

Hi Bobby,

Ok, here's another detail:  what's your web address?

Maybe Annie and Katie can come for a visit when things settle down.  I know 
Michael would be delighted. We could take them to the Pink House, if they 
preferred. Neil and I have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile.

I realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks.  
If there's anything I can do, please let me know.

You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers. I can't imagine what 
you, your dad and sister must be going through. I can relate to Katie and 
Annie, though, as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of 
sadness. I know they were close to your mom, and spent a lot of time with 
her.  What a wonderful gift of memories they must have, and what joy they 
must have brought to her life.

Subject: RE: Baby Shower for Tripp--action items



OK guys - I need help deciding what gift to get for the shower.  Jennifer's
registry can be viewed on the internet at www.babiesrus.com.  I was
thinking we could get her one of the more expensive items since there are 5
of us pitching in.  Susan suggested the 3 way pack n' play portable playard
-- sounded good to me.

Let me know what you think.  My plan is to go pick something up next
weekend.

Thanks.

Dear peoples,
From this point forward the S Halperins are somewhat on the move. This time next week Houston will be a terrific memory filled with much success and many friends. It is the birthplace of Gracie and will always hold a very special place in our hearts. As fate would have it, London is the next chapter.
From now until the end of the year, Shanna can be reached via cell phone: 713-385-7575 and her email will be: ",shalperins@yahoo.com

I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin.  The call's I am short are way out of the money.  The only positions that are changing very much in value are the Enron shares I am long and the Enron puts I am short.  I would consider closing those positions.  I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's.

I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an average maturity date of 2020.  

Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective yield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?

I didn't get a good response from the one person I know in IT.  So I am 
sending your resume out for some IT jobs I see posted on our intranet and 
have asked for help from the HR dept.  I didn't think this would take so 
long.  I appologize, but I am still trying.

""""Frank,
We had a good call today- JNPR met the criteria at 3:00PM, it was at $26.45,
within 30 minutes it had gone up to $27.32. Not bad, about 3% Plus, there
was
another stock that I didn't call- SURE it met the systems criteria at 10AM
when the stock was at $12.20- I couldn't find the news that was driving it
until it was over $13 and so I didn't call it, but it just proves again that
the system continues  to work like a charm! By the way, SURE closed today at
$15.32- If I had found the news, we all could have made over 20%. A couple
of
people bought it anyway, one in particular bought it a little earlier at
$11.00 a share and sold at $14. Not bad! Have a great night! Oh one last
story from the room that I wanted to tell you, we had a good call yesterday
as well BLDP-we called it at $27.10 and it went as high as $28.30. The funny
thing was that a new member who had been with us for only 30 minutes bought
it and made almost $500. Their first day was $500 and today they made even
more! That is what I am talking about! That's the kind of stuff that is
happening in the room. By the way, he made that $500 on a small amount of
money! Talk to you soon! And thanks again so much for the system!

Michael aka ChatMaster""""

Have a nice day.

that was not discussed was the addition of the words ""TO THE OTHER PARTY"" in 
the fourth line of Paragraph 6B.  These words were inserted as it is only 
between the parties that the waiver is effective.

If these changes meet with your approval, please have the agreement reviewed 
by your appropriate business personnel.  If acceptable at that level, please 
have two originals of the agreement signed and dated.  Once completed, a fax 
of a signed document should be forwarded to my attention (at the below fax 
number).  I will ensure it is countersigned by Enron and faxed back to your 
attention.  The originals should be forwarded for completion by Enron and, 
once completed, one fully signed original will be forwarded back to your 
attention.

I appreciate your cooperation with this matter.  Please do not hesitate to 
call me if you should need anything further.

Paul -
 
Attached is a redlined version of the  agreement.  I have basically accepted all of Williams' comments, but felt  the agreement needed to be cleaned-up a bit.  The changes are all generic  in nature and should be easily accepted by Williams.  If this is the case,  please work with Tana Jones (x33399) to have the agreement properly initialed by  Legal before signed by Tom.  If no other changes are made, I am advising  Tana to initial this document on my behalf so that Tom can sign.

It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest!  Anytime...

The current issue of Texas Monthly is only the beginning...right after we announced our current earnings last week, The Wall Street Journal originated a story about a partnership our CFO invested in that made questionable statements about conflicts of interests with the shareholders, non-disclosure of profits, etc., and have kept up with this story since last week, we have had shareholder lawsuits, SEC inquiries, our stock has taken a dive down to $15 today, down from $33 when the story first ran, and $87 since the beginning of the year.  Right now it is beat up Enron time with no end in sight.  Anyway, you may to check the WSJ website and catch up...

Also,  I have a new boyfriend, my old biking buddy I mentioned we've been dating now for a few months, that seems to be going well.  So that's all my news...

Hi Joe -
This is Marcy. Tim forwarded your email to me at home. WOW! We had not heard

the news but are very happy you let us know! How's fatherhood?? Sounds like
you have your hands full traveling back to Orlando every 2 weeks, but it's
well worth it. We wish you the best of luck and would love to see a picture
of Payton if you have one to spare. Our address is 133 Cherry Hill Road,
Greenwich, CT 06831.

Keep in touch and let us know how you and Payton are doing!

Fondly, Marcy Hanna

Dear  Joe:
 
See the attached email  from Miryam Mitchell at Stewart Gagnon's office.  Please let me know if you  agree to their suggested visitation times.  If you need to fly out earlier  on Sunday which would prevent you having him until 4:00, I'll explain that to  Miryam and suggest 1:00 to 7:00 on Saturday and 1:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Or  1:00 to 6:00 on Saturday and 12:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Let me know which  you prefer.
 
It appears that Tonya is  willing to give you increased access to Payton as he gets older and as he gets  to know you better.  I know this has been a frustrating process for  you.  I think (it is not my legal opinion since I'm not an attorney) that  it would be beneficial to request an extra hour or two at each visitation so  that we work up to overnights.  I know it can't be soon enough for you, but  small steps are always an improvement in the right  direction!!
 
Let me know about the  visitation and where you want to meet Tonya.  At your hotel?  Will you  be taking him out of Merritt Island?
 
Jonda

I thought you might appreciate the following article in Energyfax.  Read Ken Lay - Honest Man.  Apparently overstating earnings and misstating financials for years while at the same time exercising options and making yourself over $100 million is a sign of virtue.

RESPONSE DUE TO SERC OFFICE BY OCTOBER  22, 2001  
SERC Engineering Committee Representatives
It is time to determine member voting rights and membership  assessments for the year 2002. Again this year, we will calculate these  percentages based on the formula agreed to at the April 27, 1994 meeting of the  SERC Board of Directors:
    V = 10 ( 1/N) + 30(B/C) + 30(D/E) +  30(F/G)
where,
    V = % of Voting Rights
    N = Total number of Members
    B = Member's previous-year internal peak  demand
    C = Total of factor B for all  Members
    D = Member's generating capacity as of  January 1 of the reporting year
    E = Total of factor D for all  Members
    F = Sum of circuit miles of transmission  times the respective operating voltage for facilities of 69 kV and above as of  December 31 of the previous year
    G = Total of factor F for all  Members
 
The required data are: 
1) Peak Demand for the calendar year 2000, 
2) Total Capacity owned as of January 1, 2001, and  
3) Circuit miles of transmission owned as of December 31,  2000.
As a precaution, remember that 1) generation under joint  ownership, 2) generation belonging to non-members of SERC, and 3) non-utility  generation will have to be coordinated between the involved  parties.
The attached worksheet contains the information that I  have in my database for 2001.

For TVA to increase its bid, there must be increased availability.  With the
low availability of the proposed product, we valued it at $4.75.  The main
issue is the reliability of the resources.  Higher guaranteed availability
will increase the value to us.

HI Susan-

I'm totally open to whatever works best for you, truly.? That would be fun to 
have all day Saturday, and I'm really not worried about leaving you a key 
under the door mat or waking up to greet you- we can work it out.? Whenever 
you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me, too.? I'm not doing much to help 
you make a decision, I know, but I want you to do whatever is easiest and 
most comfortable for you.? I remember you having to get up at the crack of 
smack to come out here on Saturday; sometimes it's easiest to stay up later 
rather than getting up earlier!? I have virtually no plans that weekend now, 
so I'll start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekend....We 
should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter, too, since we didn't get to do 
that last time.? We'll plan on Saturday evening for that.? I'll gather some 
friends....

Hope you're having a good day!
Julie

no way I could make that one because of? work.? The other option is to fly
in Saturday morning like I did last time.? I'm leaning towards leaving
Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind
waking up to let me in.? That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things
and I wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave
around 6:00).? Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the
various options?? Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

Hey Susan,

I think my brother and his wife might be at Laura
Jahnke's wedding as well - you might say hello.

School starts in 1 1/2 weeks.  I am really excited
about starting.  I should learn at ton, and get
exposed to all sorts of things which will be helpful
in the coming years.  My parents are driving up today
to help me move into my new place, closer to school(my
parents are awesome!).

Rx-Saver.com is nearing completion.  Hopefully, we
will open for business in a few weeks.  Starting a
business has been more of a challenge than i expected.
 Just when things get rolling, a challenge raises its
ugly little head.  But, I love it.  It is alot more
fun than a 9-5 job, and there is alot more potential
to hit a homerun.

Anyways, I hope life is going great!  Say hello to
Allan and Lisa for me.


Have fun,
Paul

Jesssseka!!!!

I know, it's been ages since we've chatted.  I will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time.  

I got Clay's message and thought I'd replied, but obviously I forgot.  I'm actually going out of town next weekend.  Which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again.  Of course, I suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with Jen and Caycie's weddings coming up.

I talk to you soon,

Sue

Glad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic.

Hi Brian!  How nice to hear from you.  Congrats on being an uncle.  Scott is 
a good-looking baby!  Yes, I'm pretty psyched about little Grayson; she is a 
sweetie!  Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on 
babysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to 
understand the command ""Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on,"" 
I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush 
to have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow 
I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!

I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.  Picking up and moving can be a great 
thing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.  There is 
just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.  
The job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch ""ER,"" that is usually what my 
day looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group 
I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open 
work area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in 
business for me, and my clients are wonderful.  

Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.

Time to hit the tennis courts.

Love,
Susan

Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!  My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute 
nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!  Everyone 
tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on 
her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut 
because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.  Example:  
over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds 
of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to 
shut up.  Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies 
receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a

was just waiting for some time.  There are a lot of rumors out there? Are
you okay? The latest piece of news is your possible chapter 7 filing, and
I've been raking my mind trying to see if you guys will be taken care of in
that case. I know you all have personal contracts.  Its amazing how a great
company like Enron can come tumbling down to its knees.  I can't even
imagine the atmosphere over there, I was watching the screen as you guys
pulled all of your numbers, I really couldn't speak for a second.  This

Ollie,

Congrats on hooking up with a little long-term action.  Always thought you'd be one of the first to go.  Send her down south to Portland if it looks like she's getting board with your ""itsy bitsy"".

I've kept in touch with Carl and Brett but not much else.  Funny how time can just slip by.  I think back to the days in school and yup...just like I thought, everything seems so cool.  I think of how nice it would be to have scores of friends within a block and three bars to choose from... but it didn't seem that super at the time.  I specifically remember getting pissed on a Tuesday night, playing darts at Shakers with throngs of 20 something girls around and shrugging it off as ""boring"".  

You may be suprised to hear it, but I am still on with Enron and looking forward to a buyout in a week or so.  As strange as it may seem, this whole fiscad may have been a huge blessing in disguise...I'll just keep my fingers crossed.

I'm doing a lot of skiing this year.  Let me know when and where we should meet up.  I'd like to see the likes of Toby, Ty, Nate, Ken and even Palmy.

Glen incorporated the wrong bulletin into the guideline.  Not his fault, though.  George's website obviously had a problem and they recovered back to an old backup without knowing that they were affecting the validity of the bulletins.  I requested that someone initiate a change control to repair the examples, but I don't know who is working on this. 
  
The initial bulleting was revised a couple of times to include new revelations from RMS workshops and actual experience.

CD,
 
Let me talk to the Germans and see what they say.  I'll see if they are willing to shell out any DM's for your services.  Did you think of taking a part-time job while you are there to subsidze yourself?  Most if not all the Germans will be working for there is not too much money there for salaries.
If you send me a copy of your resume I can send it to them and perhaps they could find something suitable.  Having an EU passport is a HUGE advantage.  Speaking German would be also......
 
Don't worry.  If you really want to do this we will find a spot for you.

Wow, good for her! I think an entry level power trader usually does hourly trading stuff -and shiftwork.  Sounds like a good opportunity though.

Shelly,

The guardianship is not a Texas requirement that I am aware of so if Across
the World does not need it, then lets not worry about it.  Please do use AtW
forms, just make me a copy.  Let me look back at the requirements for the
letter regarding Chad.

I am going to forward on a post from a coordinator who saw the Austin kids
at JFK.  She has pictures of one of the Austin kids so she may have a
picture of your daughter.  She can probably tell you how she was doing at
that point.  Just email her and ask her.

Here is my two cents...

From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches 
overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  

The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on
our property or destroy the tree.  

A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is
obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since
the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a ""negligence"" issue.
Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm 
unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  

If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a ""nuisance"" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.

Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.

We are still looking for a couple of parents to attend the  Blue Barn field trip on Tuesday, October 16.  The field trip will take up  the entire school day - from 8:00 a.m. until carpool time.  Because we had  late notice about this field trip, some of the parents who originally signed up  to go cannot attend.  It is my understanding that parents drive their own  cars, while students take school busses.  I have been told that Blue Barn  is approximately 1 hour away from the school.

The answer is
 summary(g)$coef[,3:4]


The way to find out things like this is to use names() or str() to look at
the glm and summary.glm objects.
   summ<-summary(g)
   names(summ)
# I see a coefficients item. I wonder what it looks like
   summ$coefficients
# That looks familiar, it's the table of coefficients, std erros,
#p-values. I want the last two columns
   summ$coefficients[,3:4]
#Success

Or alternatively, read print.summary.glm() to see where it gets them from.

happy new year.  thanks for forwarding me this - i'm investigating all career opportunities at the moment.  i hope you've been out skiing the last few days, it looks like its been puking.  i've been sick the last few days :(  first time in a year or so.  had a great break and i'm back taking care of all the little things waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operation.  we'll see ... 

hey, do you want to go to stronghold sometime?  be good to catch up.  i don't think i'm going to be healthy this week, but if you're interested next week would work.  i don't know how much time you're spending in calgary these days.

i always urine the air

hey!  wow, now i'm really in debt - a *real* letter followed by an email!  I planned to 
write you back in vivo (rather than in silico), but you've shamed me into it.

i just talked to omar on sunday for awhile - haven't spoken to him in a long time and
it made me want to come to new york.  he was also pressuring me to come to the 
reunion, which i can't imagine doing, but are you going?  it would be fun to go back
- just a logistical pain in the ass.  

thanks for thinking of me.

it's turning into summer here now too, which is exciting, as much because the summer
is glorious as the winter is brutal.  i like canada alot.  very good people and i think i'm 
probably living in the least cool big city.  work is going well, but i don't enjoy the office
culture as much as portland, which is severly disappointing, considering that i spend
alot of time here.  still, it's not bad, just more normal/corporate.  

have you read any good books?  i sold my tv and now often find myself with the choice
of staring blankly at the wall or reading something.  more into page turners than great
works.  speaking of, i just read _kitchen confidential_, which deals with new york and also
served to make me want to visit.  you should be an actress for awhile and then write a book
about the wild and crazy life backstage.  

i heard you were in a play!  howz that?

It looks like the Smurfit deal is a gas only deal.  Susan works for Summit a 
consulting firm representing Smurfit.  I sent you the RFP last week.  In 
addition to Smurfit they are looking for gas for several other accounts.  I 
would give all the others to EES and focus your time on Smurfit.

I think it will have to sit with Smurfit in some way or  another.
I had just wanted to let you know what John had said.? I  would think you 
would require more of a procedure than what he  mentioned.

Have a wonderful night.? I have a date.

Matt is the one who told me about this and he found out  about it from John.
Today, we were able to dodge Socal's penalties because  of some flexibility
that we have.? Matt is currently assessing the  situation with regards to
penalties tomarrow.? We can buy intra-day  gas but it will be at a big
premium - and a cost to us.? I think that  we will need to include language
in our March contract to the effect that  if Smurfit doesn't schedule with
us and use a volume that is within Socal's  imposed tolerance level, we will
be able to pass the associated costs back  to Smurfit.

HOw do you think this will sit with  Smurfit?

Hi Kim

I'm OK with the March deal. After that, it's a little iffy.

I'm still not comfortable with the April-August El Paso arrangement,
especially since we really don't know how this line will work out after the
split. My preference would be to:
1) buy 1,456/day + loss gas at San Juan Index + 0.05 and flow it to So Cal
Topock(subject to true-up for curtailments); and,
2) sell other El Paso -> PG&E capacity at a future price, tbd.

I've attached my version of the term sheet.

Have a good weekend and trip. See you soon!

Lou,

Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.

Jane,

The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.

thanks,

Kim

Benjamin,

Hopefully, you will get credit or at least some recognition for the
important role you played. But you shouldn't be terribly disappointed if you
don't.  I have found in business that you don't always get credit for the
things that you truly achieved and yet sometimes you get more credit for
things than you believe that you deserved.  The relationship between
contribution and credit is often difficult to predict and sometimes defies
logic.

I believe you stepped in and made a meaningful difference in this deal.

know MOM's.
     Dad and I went out to the farm to see James Sunday and we sdrove to the
lake and their fishing place. The water is really low they don't have any
water by the pier. It's dry and hot there. The grass is really dead.
            Also Tiger went to doggie heaven about a week ago. He was
getting old and feeble. He just layed down and died. We had him a long time.

hung out with friends and enjoyed the weather.  Of course I worked in a 
little jam session with my friends.  

The week is going pretty well.  Been in a lot of meetings and those just suck 
up the time.  I am leaving today at lunch to go to Enron Field.  The Cubs are 
in town and it is an afternoon game.  Should be fun.  The Astros really stink

Can you take a look at Mariner's comments on the Confirm and GTC to see if we addressed all of their concerns in the changes that we discussed yesterday? They seem to be ok with most of the contract and only had a few comments.

The spot was terrific and exhibited high professionalism.  We were the main feature and Judi was great.  Thank you Judi for telling the ""great"" stories--and in sound bites!  A clip of Laura Bush with a voice-over telling about her involvement with the Dallas room and the growth to 84 rooms in the State followed.  Next, the two newscasters introduced their own bears they were donating to BEAR and offered viewers the opportunity to phone their station's special number (and Lori got three calls, too, within minutes of the airing) or to log onto Good News.com for more info from Channel 2.  Next,the children from St. John's school were featured as they entered the museum holding their donated bears high (no school uniforms could be seen).  The SJS students were then featured sitting in rows at the IMAX  and the voice-over explained the ""deal"" at the Museum of Natural Science.  I was thoroughly pleased and know Judy Hay will obtain multiple copies of the show for us! 
 
 Judy, let me know if I can get a tape and make copies when I am over at Murworth seeing George next Thursday/Friday.  Have a great weekend, all.  (And the Director search has not produced the perfect candidate this week.)  Linda Hunsaker

Mark - Could we arrange a telephone call with you, Mary and me this week to
discuss the North America Energy Derivatives Committee and a proposed agenda
for the near term - including the conference in Houston that you've been
discussing with Mary?  There has been no meeting for some time as you know.

Mark:

Thanks a lot for the lists.  If it's ok with you I will get back to you on
getting some contact names.

We are looking into hotels in Houston for the Energy conference in February
or March, 2001.  Is there any certain time in those months that wouldn't
work for you?  Houston is becoming a very difficult place to find hotel
availability.  The thinking was to hold an Energy conference in the U.S. in
the first half and in the U.K. sometime in the second half of the year.  It
has been mentioned that we should hold the Europe Energy conference in
Amsterdam.  My thinking is that we should first hold it in London.  What do
you think?

Regards,
Mary

Hey you back!
 
I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.  Don't take it for anything other than I was very busy.  I have no problem being friends and even getting together, whenever.
Right now I'm in a position in my life where I just want to do what I want to do, I know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how I feel.  I think after you get through with all the BS that's going on in your life you will understand where I'm coming from.  So for now don't take anything I do personally, and feel free to call whenever you want.  And, yes I wuld like to get together.....
 
Paul
And you too have a great day!!!

Group,

I received this email from Tony and thought it would be best to forward it on 
to everyone.  As you can see, we need to look closely at all communications 
between EPE and Real Time (this goes for all our service customers).  Every 
day we need to look at the dispatch or any other emails that we receive in 
the West Real-time email box.  We need to make sure we pay attention to what 
our customers want/need. It is crucial that we notice these details.  It does 
not look good when we miss these things..........

Jesse,

We may have a small communication problem developing between EPE marketing
and ENRON.  Yesterday (Monday afternoon), I sent a unit commitment for
Tuesday, January 30.  In the model, I had Copper off and a note at the
bottom of the model stating that Copper would not be available for dispatch
in the morning.  The reason I did that is because we had scheduled work on
Copper in the morning.  Since Copper is a remote start-up unit, personnel
from one of the plants (Newman) drove up to the Copper station early in the
morning (around 7:00 am, MST) to start working on the unit.  They were
surprised to find the unit running after being assured that the unit would
be off.  You can imagine the amount of calls that went back and forth
trying to figure out why the unit was running and who was responsible for
the unit being on.   Also, we had an idle crew at Copper wondering what to
do most of the morning.

Can you find out what happened and call me back so we can discuss ways of
avoiding this in the future.  Thanks, I'll put on my thinking cap to try to
come out with some ideas too.

Steph,
Great to hear from you. I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet. Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me. It should be good for our stock price though. One can hope anyway.
Glad to hear you guys are doing well. Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer. You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door.
And my liver will likely always be in shape.

Take care.

B

I like the Mcleod Resume the best. I have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback. Why don't you do another write-up and I'll go over it again. It looks like you have a good start. I will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them.
Good luck.

Thank you for your inquiry. I will do my best to answer your questions, but would prefer to answer your questions by phone. I feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions. I will usually be most available after 3 each day. You can reach me at 503-464-3730.

Todd,
From an information standpoint this looks good. I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts. You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron. The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have.
If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.
 
Thanks,
Bill

Well Aaron,
It is great to hear that you are doing well.  

Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio.  We got married in small church on the Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.  We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it off.  

As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine we will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be stuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome, London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!! 


Take care and have a great Christmas.

Paul

I've been meaning to call you, but as you can imagine, it's been extremely busy here.  Hope you're okay and I'll try to talk with you soon.  No, we still haven't received anything from Robert Allen to return our fabric.  I was hoping they would send something last week, because we shipped our gifts to Washington and we could have sent it at the same time.  Let me know what you hear from them.

Let's try to get together after the 1st.  I know it's going to be too busy this week and next, so why don't we shoot for after the new year.

If I don't talk to you soon have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Scott:
 
As discussed, here's the particulars on the Bee County  Ranch:
 
795+ ac, lots of oak trees, one of the higher hills in Bee  County.  Good mix of pasture and sage brush.  There's a water well and  tank.  
 
A real ""honey hole"".  Lots of quail and prime dove  hunting. Deer, hogs and supposedly some turkey.
 
Owner's name is Colton Brinkoeter.  Asking $675/acre, no  minerals.  Negotiable.  I think for that price you ought to get 1/4 -  1/2 of the minerals.
 
Ranch is three miles west of Mineral (NNW of Beeville about 15  miles).  His number is 361-358-2582.  I found out about it from a  mutual friend of ours, Bryan Key, also from Beeville.
 
P.S.  I've also attached my resume.  It looks like  our pipe deal fell through, and I am looking hard for a job back in  international marketing.  Let me know if you hear of anything.

I don't think so, but I am not exactly sure how the program works.  I believe that you are to be reimbursed at the end of each semester after you receive your grades.  However, you would need to be employed with Enron at that time to be reimbursed.

I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students 
that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.  
 I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her 
and I agree with your comments. 

Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought 
might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option 
Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading 
that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock 
Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have 
read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It 
is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A 
must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.

Sincerely,

Scott Neal

quality service in the hourly market indices.  We have enhanced (expanding
via. overnight reporting team) and shifted our publishing time from
mid-morning to 6:00am allowing the hourly traders the ""early bird-first
look"".  The upside of these positive changes is obvious.

Again, I look forward to speaking with you the week of August 13th.

What time are you getting married on September 22nd? Is the trip to Mexico
still on and if so, what is the date for that and who do I need to contact
for details? Also, do you have Travis's phone number so I can get a resume

Pat Hallisey has volunteered to organize the events, circumstances and data
that occurred last week concerning the storm.  He has presented a very
thorough outline of  the document.  He is asking for comments from all of the
residents.  We do realize that many of the residents do not have time right
now to write their  experiences and many people are not receiving the emails.
 It is very important from an historical point of view that we do document
events so that presentations can be made on behalf of the residents at future
meetings and planning sessions.  Thank you. Mary G. Strickland

MESSAGE FROM PAT HALLISEY  --
Ok, Just as a starting point below I will list the beginning of an outline
for the Clear Creek Village view of Tropical Storm Allison.  I hope each of
you will add a section or sub-section to it and supply information.

If I understood Peggy Zahler correctly, I think what she asked for  a
perspective that would chronicle the events, circumstances and data that
occurred from Tuesday June 5-10, 2001 for the purpose of having a historical
perspective of how Tropical Storm Allison and its remnants effected Clear
Creek Village.

Please keep in mind this is only a beginning, all data can be sent to Pat
Hallisey, 2205 Acacia, 281-332-0157.  ",hallisey@wt.net

Well, as per usual, the plans are getting all botched.  Why can't people
just commit to a plan and roll with it?  Bill is now going to Disney...what
the f is that all about?  After checking into some new ideas (different
rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last
ideas and have determined that most likely we will probably just have to
settle for chilling at the point, using Mom and Don's boat and tying up at
the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my
girlfriends from Roch may join us as well.  Should be good!  So what does
your itinerary look likle?   love, k

Splus 2000 r3.

I have fit a 2-parameter Weibull distribution to a data vector (fire-free
intervals in forests) and would like to compute the probability that the
shape parameter is greater than 1.  I can use bootstrap() [I presume] to
compute the standard error.  Is there a closed expression for CIs? (I
imagine a normal approximation would be pretty lame here).

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Larry,
    Given your background and association with the Naval Reserve, I would
recommend that as your quickest route to intelligence analysis.  However, do
not limit yourself to DIA and NSA.  Go on-line to www.firstgov.org   and
look at all of the US intelligence community employment opportunities,
including the FBI , CIA, and Treasury, et al.  Your language skills and
foreign travel will be especially valuable.

    I would be pleased to advise you as you pursue a career change.
Cheers/JWL

The terminated CIG OBA had language to cashout at the NGPL MidCon price in
the month after the OBA was terminated (10/31/01).
The 11/2001 index price was $2.173/dth * 1,443 dth = $3,135.64 due CIG

Mojave
The old Mojave OBA does not have cashout language related to the 11/30/2001

cashout.

I wanted to know about connecting into the suction of WT-1 (Not sure I have
the name correct, but the station located off of HWY 180/62 Carlsbad/Hobbs
Highway).  We have a line we are evaluating converting to lean gathering.
It passes about 1 mile from this station.  Is it possible to connect there.
We will be looking for 19 MMCFD initially and then increasing to 30 if the
volume shows up.  We currently have about 13 MMCFD we would take into this

Good day, everyone,

News from Continental regarding the reinforcement of cockpit doors and some
changes to the check-in procedure at George Bush Intercontinental Airport:




CONTINENTAL AND CONTINENTAL EXPRESS 
TO REINFORCE COCKPIT DOORS

HOUSTON, October 3, 2001 -- Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) and its
regional air carrier Continental Express (NYSE: CAL) will begin immediate
installation of secondary reinforcing restraints on cockpit doors to enhance
security on their aircraft, pending receipt of Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) final criteria specifications. With approval, the
airlines plan to complete installation on all of Continental's 341 aircraft
and Continental Express' 160 aircraft within 30 days. 


THE MOVE IS ON
Houston's Paris, London and Tokyo Flights Check-in at Terminal C

What: Terminal change for flight check-in 
When: Effective Tuesday, October 16, 2001
Flights affected: Continental flights from Houston to London, Paris and
Tokyo 

Effective October 16, 2001, passengers traveling on Continental from Houston
to London, Paris and Tokyo will check-in at Terminal C in George Bush
Intercontinental Airport (IAH). There will no longer be any passenger
check-in facilities in Terminal D. Moving the check-in of these flights to
Terminal C will streamline operations and help process passengers through
the airport more efficiently.

STEVE: I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your
asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron's
Washington office. Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning
to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased
to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter.

In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any
questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would
have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe
Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who
currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some
neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she
report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the
Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs?

I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's
clear that government relations are  much more central to the work of Enron
than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.
Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with this
tardy line of questioning. With best wishes, CHASE.

Subject: Paul Portney, President, Resources for the Future to appear on
Washington Journal


	As a valued member of the RFF Council, we thought you might
appreciate knowing that Resources for the Future President Paul Portney
has been asked to appear on C-SPAN's ""Washington Journal"" this Wednesday
(August 15th) between 8am and 9am for a live, hour-long interview.

	It is a unique and unprecedented opportunity to enlighten a
national television audience about RFF itself - its mission, research,
history and future goals, much of which you have helped to support.

	C-SPAN's request for the interview followed intense media
coverage of Dr. Portney's work chairing the National Academy of Sciences
committee on fuel economy standards, and Katherine Probst's
widely-reported study on the future costs of Superfund.

	You can also access the interview online at www.c-span.org and
click on the live TV/radio programs icon at the top of the page.

	Thank you.

had
nothing but problems with my email as I've switched several times. Anyway,
my

like
to take him up on his previous offer, from our last meeting, to introduce
me
to the key leaders in EES. Currently, I'm engaged in a consulting
assignment
which may take me back to Asia but I know that I will be in town June 8 and

11. I will be traveling to the west coast next week but you can always
reach
me on my mobile or email. Thanks for calling me back. See ya soon!

Stan,
I plan to participate on tomorrow's conference call on your behalf. 

I met with Rae earlier today and had a quick preview of this document.  The 
crux of the recommendation is that Rae would like to take a procedural vote 
at the March 2 Board meeting on whether the Board intends to move forward 
with pursuing retail standards.

If the procedural vote is ""yes,"" then she is proposing to have Jay Costan and 
Bill Boswell start drafting the governance documents.  I mentioned that I 
would like to participate in reviewing the Bylaws and Certificate as your 
representative.

I think that the attached backround and Feb. 14 meeting summary is fine.  I 
have lots of thoughts on the possible organizational structure document -- 
but these are probably best saved until the Board votes on its intentions.  
I'd say the procedural vote is too close to call at this point.   Rae reports 
that Warren Mitchell of SoCal Gas, Reliant, End-Users and a number of state 
commissioners are firmly behind moving forward.

Whistler/Blackcomb
British Colombia, Canada
    February 24-28, 2001

Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow

....and that's just what it's doing at spectacular Whistler/Blackcomb in
British Colombia, Canada!  The world's top-ranked slopes already boast a
31-inch base with a foot of new powder and 200 open trails!  So dust off
those skis, check out your equipment and pack your bags for the WPO Ski TAG!

Enjoy wonderful days skiing the best slopes with expert guides and
instructors, evening socials in the delightful restaurants at the base of
the mountains peppered with educational sessions including speakers like
Doug Forseth, SVP of Whistler/Blackcomb Operations.  A special evening is
planned for Tuesday the 27th, a celebration of New Orleans' Fat Tuesday!

The best of all worlds is the time spent with family and fellow WPOers
comparing runs, trails, moguls and even the occasional fall.  The rigors of
the day, the friendships of old and new, and the laughter and relaxation of
the evenings are sure to be a highlight of this winter season.

Dear MaryAnn,

I was very disappointed to learn today that the Enron Body Shop will be
raising its rates to $25 per month.  While this may be in line with some
benchmarking study, one would hope that Enron would seek to outperform its
peers, given its goal to be rated #1 as best place to work.  Our cross-town
competitor Williams, where I worked for almost 12 years, has a facility that
is at least as good as Enron's, and there is no charge whatsoever.  Why
charge for the use of a facility that promotes Wellness?

I hope you reconsider this increase, but at a minimum provide a lower rate
for the occasional user such as myself.  Given my busy schedule I am lucky
to get there a few times per month, and would happily pay the greater of $5
per visit or the $25/month fee.  A $25/month fee will simply discourage
occasional users.

Please terminate my membership, effective September 1.   I hope that I am
not alone in voicing my unhappiness with this increase.

Sincerely,

I understand that Enron has just terminated

I was just reading over some verses I have posted around my cube and I noticed the Luke 10:27 ""You shall love the Lord you God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength and with all your mind....""
All of the sudden, it wasn't ""You gotta do this...."" But God saying, ""I'm gonna love you so much you are going to love me with all your heart, all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind.... I'm gonna make you fall in love with me!"" 
I was just thinking how much God is ""winning my heart"" in all of this. 
I JUST LOVE Jesus, don't you???!!!! There REALLY is NONE like our GOD!!!!!! 
Hope you heard about how God is ministering to your ""flock"". The Astros and Enron Field are hosting a Job Fair. KSBJ is somehow participating and also offering ministerial services for coping. They are in such good hands. God is so good. The Good Shepherd.

As one means of keeping the Board more informed about the increased
attention being paid to RFF in the press, we are attaching an excerpt
from RFF In The News.  It is a rolling update of when, where, and in
what context RFF scholars and RFF publications are cited by the media.
We have created this evolving tracking mechanism and are still tweaking
it to comprehensively capture citations of RFF in the print and
electronic press, at a reasonable cost, and in a manner that is useful
both internally and in promoting RFF via the Web.

We would welcome your reactions.

Dear Kenneth:
On behalf of Credit Suisse First Boston, I would like to invite you to join
us for the PGA Tour Championship which will be held at Champions Golf Club
in Houston from Thursday, November 1st  through Sunday November 4th.
The Tour Championship is an annual event which showcases the top 30 money
winners and features one of the largest purses of the year on the PGA Tour.
Champions Golf Club, which has also hosted the Ryder Cup, the PGA
Championship, the United States Open and the United States Amateur, will
once again host the Tour Championship, following up on the extremely
successful 1999 and 1997 Tour Championships.  The field this year should be
very exciting, as it is likely to include Tiger Wood, David Duval, Phil
Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Davis Love III.
We would like you and a guest to join us for the  3rd and 4th rounds of the
Tour Championship on Saturday and Sunday.  We will be hosting a private
hospitality chalet adjacent to the 9th green, from which you will be able to
watch the tournament or take a break from following your favorite players on
the course.  We sponsored the same chalet for the 1997 and 1999 Tour
Championships, and it provided a wonderful setting to view the players
up-close on the 9th hole, as well as provide a cool environment to enjoy
some food and drinks.
In order to assist us in our planning, we ask that you take a moment to
respond via e-mail indicating your interest by Friday, October 26th.  We
will provide additional details upon your acceptance.
We hope you will join us for this exciting event and we look forward to
seeing you there.
Sincerely,


Karen A. White on behalf of Osmar Abib

Ken--

At the conclusion of our phone conversation, you indicated that I should get
back with you if we were having any difficulty in pursuing our interest in
acquiring the Enron wind business.  Knowing the many demands on your time, I
regret to have to come back to you.  However, despite repeated attempts, we
are still locked out of negotiations over the wind asset and have been
unable to receive information we've requested.  Our phone calls have been
returned, but information and/or a seat at the table have not been
forthcoming.

Can we discuss this again by pbone?  Alternatively, as I suggested in a note
to you on Monday, we stand ready at any moment to come visit you in person
about this if you might have even 15 minutes for us.

Again, apologies for coming back to you about this.  But, it would be
extremely helpful if you could assist us in being able to move forward on
our interest in bidding on this business.

Many thanks!

Rosie...absolutely!!  I'll make my schedule work.  However, unless this is a personal favor Ken is doing for the gentlemen involved, I'd also be happy to ""field"" this for him.  I told Ken we(University Affairs/Public Affairs) would not impose on his schedule for these kinds of visits until after January.  Clearly, there are occasions where some of Ken's many friends contact him directly, and , as kind as Ken is, even at extreme times, he agrees.   However, if this is not a personal visit, I'm quite certain this dean is looking for a better financial and recruiting relationship with Enron.  In fact, we are putting together a ""master Plan"""" financial relationship with UT overall (Rick Causey is the exec lead), and realistically, we are not recruiting engineers per se.  So Rosie my darling friend, let me know if you'd like me to politely intervene and take this off your list, or if this  is one of those personal friendship situations, in which case, I'll be there on the 14th!
 
Thanks and kisses!!

Hi Christie - 

Would you be able to join Ken in this meeting?  As you can see, we don't have a lot of information.  If you feel it would be good to talk to John Halton (who will also be attending the meeting with Dean Ben Streetman), he can be reached at 512-471-2120.

Thanks much and take care.

Dear Ken:

We have very serious offers out to two young - but very highly
regarded - economists doing work in areas of interest to Enron.
(Please see enclosed.)

Hendricks is being recruited for one of the Lay family chairs.

Rust, now at Yale, is being recruited for our new university-wide
Center in Computational Economics and Finance.  His work is likely to
be of considerable interest to Enron.

Dear Mr. Lay,
 
I have no idea if this e-mail will reach you, but, I felt I would at least try.  My name is Jim Edwards and I am the CEO of Brittan Communications International, Inc., (BCI). For different reasons and on a scale that 1/1000th of that of Enron, BCI had to shut it's doors in the midst of a great deal of mis-understandings and information.  The people that got hurt by it caused me great emotional pain at many levels, for it was not my desire at any time to do anything except that it was good for them.  
 
One can feel very alone at a time like this and words can not describe all the feelings that go with an event like this for someone in your position.  I do feel that I can relate because of my experience with BCI.  Other than to tell you that you are not alone, and that you will survive this to go forward again, I can not say much that will help.  Take heart, hold on, and believe.  Prayer helps and I will say one for you. If for any reason you wish to talk my number is 281-558-6365, my e-mail is ",jgedwards@hotmail.com

Dear Mr. Lay,

I went home yesterday along with the other 3,999 employees who lost
their jobs at Enron.  Even though we had weeks to prepare for the worst,
when the layoffs occurred, it really hit me hard.

I cried a great deal, not only about the uncertainty of my future, but
for the loss of relationships and friendships that I had established
over the last five years I spent at Enron.  The hardest aspect of
yesterday was saying ""goodbye"" to my friends and co-workers.

We've all made a resolution to stay in touch and hopefully we will all
pick up the pieces and carry on with our lives.

I appreciate the efforts that were made to get us some severance, but as
you are well aware, gave so much of ourselves to the company and lost so
much in return..

I'm sure I'm not alone in encouraging you and Enron management to
continue to push for additional severance for those of us who lost our
jobs.  This is a hard time to hit the street looking for a job, while
Continential, Compaq and now Enron have downsized and the holidays are
upon us.

I know you have probably received this kind of message  many times in
the last few weeks, but I hope you will continue to do the right thing
for the employees.  We need the additional severance to be able to
ensure food on the table and roofs over our heads until we can land on
our feet after this free fall.

I will never regret my 5 years at Enron.  They are an important part of
my past.

I appreciate your consideration of this request.

Sincerely,

Kathleen Pope-Sance

Mr.  Lay:
 
Believe it or  not I strongly believe in and practice the values listed below.  I really  did expect Enron to believe them and practice them as  well.
 
What Enron did  to us Monday afternoon is not in accordance to the values listed  below.
 
I'm now on the  brink of bankruptcy because I cannot find a job.  I'm 49 years old and  because I enlisted in the Navy during Vietnam, with 9 years service instead of  going on to college, I do not have a degree.  I have more experience than  most anyone with a degree, but so far that doesn't help.  Most  times all they look at is that piece of paper.
 
I hope someday  you feel what I'm feeling and understand what I'm going through.  You  guys that did this with your millions in reserve probably never will fully  understand.

Ken,

After numerous efforts to secure an audience with President Fox, we have
been successful in scheduling a lunch with him on the 27th of June.  In
addition to our usual reasons for taking this very important one-day
trip, I have been advised by Presidencia (equivalent for our ""West
Wing"") that during this face-to-face meeting, we would have the
appropriate opportunity to invite President Fox to visit Houston.  I
have just received written confirmation of the 2:30 p.m. luncheon
meeting.  I will be going to appropriate GHP Boardmembers and major
investors to determine who would be available to participate.   I wanted
to give my leadership heads up and request any thoughts or ideas that
you may have on this subject matter as well as to determine your

raised and we have several proposals outstanding.  I'm writing to ask your
help with Jack Trotter, a trustee of the Vivian L. Smith Foundation.

Earlier this year you indicated that you would be willing to sign a letter
to Mr. Trotter on behalf of the Library/Honors building project.  Enclosed
is a draft of the letter.  A proposal for $250,000 was submitted to the
Foundation in May, the trustees are scheduled to meet on June 15.  Mr.
Trotter is a trustee with both the M.D. Anderson Foundation (which has
already committed $1 mil to the library/honors project) and the Vivian L.
Smith Foundation.  The Smith Foundation provided a grant of $500k to the
KUHT/KUHF Melcher building that opened last fall.

Please let me know if you have any question regarding the enclosed letter.
Also, please fax or e-mail the final letter to me at the address below.

Thank you very much.

Happy New Year!  I hope you and your family are all happy and well, and I
just wanted to send a little hello from snowy Boston.

I finished my first semester at Harvard Business School relatively
unscathed.   It's really strange to be a student again!  I am enjoying it,
and am
learning a ridiculous amount, and there is just way too much information to
actually ingest.  It's good fun,
but some of the people are really arrogant!  The people are not as nice as I
thought they would be.
They're all very interesting, but a lot of them are just investment bankers
who want to back into investment banking.
The profs here are fantastic, however, and it's been a very interesting
semester.

I would love to hear about how you're doing, about Enron North America, etc.

What ever happened to the S. Texas wind deal?  You know I am going to keep
asking you about it... I hope that the turbines have ALREADY been built
and you're making tons of money off of them!

All the best, and Happy New Year!

That's right!? I will be joining Global Energy Markets (G.E.M.) as a managing 
director of coal and emissions trading.? Last month, Allegheny Energy 
announced the acquisition of Merrill Lynch's energy trading division, G.E.M., 
for $490 million plus 2% equity interest in Allegheny. The main purpose of 
this transaction is to combine G.E.M's established trading and risk 
management business with Allegheny's substantial portfolio of low cost 
generation. The transaction is expected to close before the end of this 
quarter.? I will be trading and optimizing Allegheny's coal and emissions 
positions.? G.E.M. will continue to be headquartered in Manhattan.? Allegheny 
has a great portfolio of coal and gas generation (approx. 18 million tons of 
coal consumption per year) and has a dynamic five-year plan for further 
growth through acquisition and development (18,000 MW by 2005).? I am 
extremely excited to be back in the 'coal game' and especially to work with 
the deep pool of trading talent at G.E.M.? 

I will be starting my new position as soon as my obligations to Sithe have 
been fulfilled.? In the meantime, I can be reached by cell phone (917 913

I got a response on the same day you sent it to them.  I think it is automatically generated.  Thanks again for passing it on.  I will be busting my ass to find a job after my vacation and will be much more proactive.  It's hard to try too hard knowing you will be out of the country for two weeks.   I will keep you posted.  I will have access to this shitty email account overseas.  Talk to you later.  By the way, this is what they sent me.

Diana,

I just spoke with Gerry.  He has spoken with Vicky at PG&E.  Everything seems to be falling in place.  He indicates that he will need to invoice us for this transaction.  We will not be netting against the power sale.

Let's keep in touch.  I will be at your beck and call should you need something.

Once you have everything in place, let me know.  I will keep Gerry apprised.

Laird

O.K.!  Just to keep you appraised of what I'm doing,  I have left a message with Bob Sullivan @ CISO and I spoke to WAPA.  I think the call to WAPA was just to notify them that they won't be managing Shasta's transmission position for the term of our deal.  I'm going to be working with Bob Sullivan to create procedures for scheduling purposes.  Not sure if you want to stay in the loop for that?  You can update Gerry though, for me.  I appreciate your help!

Thanks

Diana

Diana,

Great work.  Is there anything you need me to do?

If everything is in place, I will contact Gerry Cupp at Shasta letting him know.  Or, if he needs to do something, I will get that started.

Thanks,

Laird

Diana-

  We seem to be off on both Purchases and Sales for November '01 for Modesto.  I'm thinking it may have to do with the $26 deal....(?)

  Can you look over these numbers and tell me if you agree with Modesto.  Given everything that has happened lately, I'm not sure who is correct.

  Thanks,

Diana,

As I recall, you are our rep on the ISAS.  I have read the E-Tag document and it looks OK to me.  Are there any problems with the document from your perspective that I should be aware of?  It looks like the new procedure will be in effect within a month or so (I assume after any voting as noted below)  In the meantime, there will be a WMIC meeting on August 23 and 24 that I plan on attending, if there are any issues you have with the linked document below or anything else, please let me know so I can raise the issue at the WMIC.

Thanks,

Bad news girls:

I just got a call from Pam's secretary who let me know that Pam's brother
Russ was killed in a car accident last week.  Pam and I were supposed to
have lunch this week and she called to fill me in.  I don't know many of the
details yet because her secretary did not know much.

Apparently they are having a military service in Seattle and they will
probably bury him in Texas since Pam's parents are moving to Texas soon.  I
don't know when the service in Texas will be.

Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers because I know that this is
going to be terribly hard for her.  She and Russ were very close.

I'll fill you in as soon as I know more,

Those idiots. I was in a hurry and didn't want to miss my flight, so i walked out and assumed that they would just bill the credit card.

But before I left I gave the tux to the front desk and gave them your name and room number. The guy was like, ""Okay"" and then walked to the back room without writting your name or anything down. So i told him again what name and room number. He said ""no problem"".

Oh well. Sorry about the trouble and thanks for the invite. It was a great wedding.

NGPL has filed an application requesting approval to sell its interest in 
certain offshore facilities to Green Canyon and is also requesting 
non-jurisdictional status of the subject facilities.  Northern owns an 
undivided interest in certain of the facilities being sold by NGPL.    The 
Commission has issued a data request to Northern regarding its interest in 
the subject offshore facilities.  I just became aware of this data request 
this morning.  

The FERC has requested that Northern provide the following:

""Northern is requested to present formally its views to the Commission on the 
jurisdictional status of its fractional ownership interest in these 
facilities.  These submissions should include specific information regarding 
the current classification of the facilities, for purposes of accounting and 
rate treatment. "" 

Because Northern's response is due on Thursday, November 9th, I have taken 
the liberty of drafting a response for your review.  This response is similar 
to Northern's previous responses in other dockets.  Please  provide your 
comments by noon, Wednesday, November 8 as Northern must send its response to 
Washington in overnigth mail for filing on
